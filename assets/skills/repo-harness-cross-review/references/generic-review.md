# Generic acceptance review

Acceptance uses the existing fleet `deep-reasoner` role and task-agent runtime.
Prepare verification, provide a dedicated linked reviewer checkout and a JSON
address file `{endpoint:{session,configPath?,home?},parent_pane}`. Trust the exact
checkout through the normal operator workflow before starting; never respond to
trust/update/approval prompts automatically.

```bash
repo-harness review round --contract tasks/contracts/<task>.contract.md --reviewer-repo <linked> --herdr-endpoint <address.json>
repo-harness review status --contract tasks/contracts/<task>.contract.md
repo-harness review close --contract tasks/contracts/<task>.contract.md
```

Default selection uses an existing typed task binding for the parent pane and chooses
its opposite. Unknown identity requires `--harness claude|codex`. Explicit
selection never falls back; only a missing opposite executable before start
allows a reported fallback to a separate owner-harness reviewer. No launch or
request is replayed after an ambiguous outcome.

At most three changed-subject repair rounds retain the same task-agent. Prior
findings require stable IDs and open/resolved status. The reviewer may write
only each exact Result file; terminal history/sentinel/idle are observation.
The owner immutably collects the file, validates domain identity and findings,
consumes OAR Session model observation and calls the existing generic-review
Receipt writer/verifier. Receipt validity is launcher-independent.

Close requires the current passing Receipt to equal the final accepted round.
On failure use `repo-harness review cancel --contract <path>` for identity-proven
cleanup without acceptance. Preserve unknown delivery and cleanup evidence.
The server and attached parent/workspace remain with their existing owner.
Drain pre-cutover sessions with the prior version; archive old evidence read-only.

The fixed Node >=24 OAR host runs inside a visible Herdr pane under macOS
Seatbelt: all filesystem writes outside the canonical output tree are denied, except the
proved /dev/null device literal; TMPDIR is private inside output,
including inherited descendant writes. The paired zero-model fixture proves
that policy; real native/runtime behavior is still unverified. Other platforms
fail closed. The host deletes inherited OAR_CODEX_SANDBOX; stock OAR selects Codex
danger-full-access, with cwd=output. The OS boundary is the protection authority. Stock OAR supplies Claude's bypass flag under the
explicitly approved OS boundary; the app adds no vendor arguments.

Claude's current OAR model event is system/init only. It cannot certify the
actual gateway backend, so Claude Results cannot mint a Receipt yet. Hooks,
complete packet ingestion, forced host-loss cleanup and native isolation remain
unverified. On normal cleanup SDK dispose acknowledgement and execution-owner
exit precede pane close; missing proof remains pending.
The independent direct Codex advisory runtime is retired. New acceptance
requests use this generic domain; the removed command is not an alias or fallback.

Current zero-prompt native evidence: Claude 2.1.284 constructed and disposed
under the boundary despite denied state/plugin/trust writes; no native state
directory is granted. Codex 0.160.0 app-server exited while the probe-window OS
log recorded denied root SQLite/WAL/SHM writes. Broad ~/.codex is not a pure
state directory and is never opened; that runtime is currently unsupported.
No real review/model capability is certified by a startup probe. All native
state allowances must avoid protected authorities and keep settings, hooks,
trust, instructions/definitions and credentials denied, including inside an
otherwise writable tree. The fixed host refuses Session creation without the
owner-admitted profile and live Seatbelt denial evidence.


23:07 Codex admission is narrow: tmp subpath plus six state/log SQLite literals,
with root/tmp/file symlink refusal and protected-authority overlap checks. The
single zero-prompt recheck still exited: goals, memories/queue SQLite and
installation_id writes were denied. Those paths remain closed; no retry or
additional grant. Codex stays unsupported and Claude's prior init-only-model
limitation is unchanged.


23:29 adds only goals/memories/queue SQLite families and installation_id as ten
literals. Aimpact accepts the unverified later-session goals/memories channel.
The single zero-prompt recheck still fails thread/start: the OS denies
thread-writer-locks/.coordination.lock. No additional grant or relaunch; Codex
remains unsupported. Real turns/further paths remain unverified.


23:56 adds only thread-writer-locks as a subpath. The single zero-prompt SDK
constructor/dispose succeeded, but new model-cache, shell-snapshot, plugin and
thread-history writes were denied; all remain closed and the probe stopped.
This is startup/disposal evidence only, not real-turn readiness or Receipt
certification. No plugin or broader root grant is implied.


2026-10-03 00:27 replaces every real Codex state grant with owner-prepared
output/.codex-home. Only auth is copied (exclusive/no-follow, 0700/0600), only
access exp is checked against the run window, and CODEX_HOME is passed through
OAR SessionOptions.env. No config/trust/instruction copy; auth/config writes
remain denied. Owner deletes the copy on close/cancel/start failure/timeout;
failed deletion is cleanup_pending. One zero-prompt startup and one authorized
round18 production Codex review/Receipt write+verify passed in a disposable
private session. This certifies that observed runtime/fixture path, not backend
identity, future versions, network isolation, refresh safety or Claude Receipt.
