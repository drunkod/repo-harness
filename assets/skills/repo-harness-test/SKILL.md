# repo-harness-test

Router for testing work. Policy prose is owned elsewhere; this package carries
only executable technique and the tools this repository actually ships.

## Mode Selection

Confirm the target is the repo-harness source checkout before using these
references. For downstream projects, use their own test commands, fixtures and
CI; do not apply these source-only paths or lane assumptions.

- About to write, extend, or name a test, or choosing a fixture -> `references/authoring.md`.
- Choosing which tests to run, or finding where suite time goes -> `references/running.md`.
- Moving, splitting, merging, or deleting tests, and owing proof that nothing was lost -> `references/refactor-evidence.md`.
- Writing a contract's `Verification Plan`, or deciding which CI lane a change lands in -> `references/verification-plan.md`.

## Boundaries

- Testing policy authority is `docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md`,
  section `## Testing Policy and Artifact Standards`. This package restates
  none of it and creates no second policy; when the two appear to disagree,
  that section wins and this package is wrong.
- Not for diagnosing a failure's root cause; that is `hunt`.
- Not for reviewing a diff, PR, or release readiness; that is `check`.
- Runs nothing on the user's behalf, writes no acceptance evidence, and never
  edits a contract's recorded results.
