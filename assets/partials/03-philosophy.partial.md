### 7. Development Protocol

> **Core Philosophy**: Code is toilet paper when contracts change; durable truth belongs in repo-local artifacts, not chat memory.

#### The Layered Truth

- **PRODUCT TRUTH**: `docs/spec.md`
- **EXECUTION TRUTH**: `plans/`
- **DONE TRUTH**: `tasks/contracts/`, `tasks/reviews/`, `tasks/notes/`, `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`, `.ai/harness/runs/`
- **MUTABLE LAYER**: `src/`

#### Response Protocol (Concise)

```yaml
NEW_FEATURE_FLOW:
  1. Define acceptance criteria
  2. Define contract
  3. Write failing tests
  4. Implement and verify

BUG_FIX_FLOW:
  1. Reproduce with test
  2. Fix root cause
  3. Run the regression guard and affected focused checks
  4. Expand verification only for an explicit acceptance requirement or an observed coverage gap
```

#### Verification Scope

Use the project's required checks and the active contract as the verification
scope. A small code/test edit does not by itself require the full suite. Before
adding a full-suite criterion, identify the cross-module risk that named focused
checks cannot cover, or the explicit release requirement. Freeze code before
expensive acceptance, declare checks with explicit cost and evidence policy in the JSON `Verification Plan`,
and consume current subject-bound evidence across worker, review, and closeout.
Declare each executable check once; a cache miss cannot authorize an expensive rerun.
After a full pass, bounded follow-up edits use the recorded baseline plus focused
delta checks. The parent revises final criteria when the full-suite trigger no
longer applies; a cache miss or changed hash alone does not require another full
run. Never claim the old full pass covers the new subject.

#### Artifact Hygiene

- Write comments, commit messages, and PR text from the final diff only, as if discarded intermediate attempts never existed.
- Comments state only the non-obvious reason at the owning boundary; never restate the operation, preserve intermediate attempts, or list speculative future work.
- PR text states final behavior plus only the material rationale or trade-off a reviewer cannot recover from the diff; never mention never-merged states or reverted work.
