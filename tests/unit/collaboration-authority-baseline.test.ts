/**
 * C0 — collaboration / delivery two-plane authority freeze.
 *
 * Sprint row C0 of
 * `plans/sprints/20260828-2321-collaborative-work-exchange-agent-succession.sprint.md`.
 * Frozen decisions: `docs/researches/20260829-c0-collaboration-two-plane-authority-freeze.md`.
 *
 * This file adds no behavior. It enumerates the delivery-plane authorities that
 * the collaboration substrate (C1-C9) must leave untouched, freezes their
 * protocol versions and wire identities into one canonical digest, and pins the
 * baseline negative proof that today's read-only delegation admission does not
 * consume `delegation_policy`.
 *
 * The inventory is not hand-maintained against the source: every module it draws
 * from is also imported as a namespace, and `C0 authority inventory completeness`
 * below asserts set equality between what the module exports and what the
 * inventory declares. Adding a `*_KIND` or `*_PROTOCOL` export to any inventoried
 * module turns this file red until the inventory is updated.
