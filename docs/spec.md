# Product Spec

> **Status**: Approved
> **Owner**: repo-harness maintainers

## Product Outcome

`repo-harness` makes long-running AI engineering work reviewable and resumable
inside the repository while keeping unified workflow helper implementation in
the global package runtime. A maintainer should be able to hand Claude, Codex,
or a future agent an approved plan or sprint, let it work in an isolated branch
or worktree, and review completion from files: plan, contract, notes, checks,
trace, review, and handoff.

The same authority model may support persistent logical Module Engineers. The
engineer is a repo-defined role with a reviewed SOP and repo-grounded knowledge;
a Codex App Thread or Herdr CLI Agent is only its replaceable runtime binding,
while native Subagents remain bounded workers under one canonical task claim.

## Primary Users

- Maintainers adopting an existing repository that already has product code.
- Engineers running Claude/Codex sessions across multiple days, hosts, or
  worktrees.
- Reviewers who need a concise human review card plus machine evidence before
  accepting agent-authored changes.

An optional local MCP sidecar can expose the same file-backed workflow contract
to ChatGPT. Its default profiles remain workflow-scoped; a separate, user-owned
`coding` profile may directly edit and run Bash only for explicitly granted
repos.

## Non-Goals

- `repo-harness` is not a hosted agent gateway, hosted product runtime, or
  database service. The MCP sidecar remains a loopback local process behind an
  operator-managed tunnel.
- It does not replace the target repository's build, test, deploy, or release
  authority.
- It does not vendor unified helper scripts into downstream repositories; the
  canonical helper invocation is `repo-harness run <helper>`.
- It does not treat chat history, SQLite state, or hosted agent threads as the
  durable source of truth.

## Core Invariants

- Durable truth lives in repo files: `plans/`, `tasks/contracts/`,
  `tasks/reviews/`, `tasks/notes/`, `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`,
  `.ai/harness/runs/*.json`, and `.ai/harness/handoff/`.
- Helper implementation is package-owned for adopted downstream repositories;
  root `scripts/` in this repository are self-hosted source/runtime only.
- `tasks/current.md` is a generated orientation snapshot, not a kanban board,
  live lock, or implementation gate.
- Agents may only widen scope by editing the active contract and leaving
  reviewable evidence.
- Contract verification, review recommendation, external acceptance or manual
  override, and latest trace evidence are required before closeout.
- Hooks remain fail-open observers. The prepare-acceptance gate recomputes a
  policy-base-bound Change Assessment packet over final content; it selects
  high-risk paths and required executable oracles without making Hook journals
  or model judgments into authority. Each risk reason must have an allowed
  oracle covering every selected path or `*`. AcceptanceReceipt remains the
  sole merge authority by recomputing and binding that packet in canonical
  verification evidence.
- Worktree isolation protects unrelated dirty state; agents must not absorb
  unrelated changes from the target tree.
- Direct coding MCP is default-off, user-scoped, OAuth profile/revision-bound,
  worktree-first, and explicit that local-user Bash is not a filesystem sandbox.
- Continuation surfaces are non-authoritative: the continuation envelope is a
  read-only projection of effective state plus the sprint marker, the closeout
  journal records operation progress for explicit recovery only (never workflow
  state, never read by state resolution), and attempt receipts are liveness
  evidence that never enter effective state or `progress_token`.
- Agent Runtime effects are provider-neutral, at-most-once control-plane effects.
  An adapter receives only a bounded inbox-control reference after intent and
  `effect_started` are durable; only the exact persisted Task or Module Inbox
  receipt proves delivery, and every ambiguous outcome requires reconciliation
  without an automatic retry.
- An unattended automation run is bounded by one machine-enforced budget, never
  by prompt text. Every claim, dispatch, retry, and provider invocation first
  takes a reservation under the run's exclusive lock, and a reservation that
  would pass any hard limit is refused before the operation happens.
- The budget store's caller is untrusted for every decision input; the host
  process is the only trusted source. The store reads its own clock, derives the
  reserved vector from the operation kind, derives the charge from the outcome
  the host observed, and reads and digests the task contract from the repository
  itself. A caller names what it wants to do and what happened; it never states
  what that costs or when it happened. The limits are the host-owned
  `ProgramAuthorizationV1` / `ProgramBudgetLimitV1` grant composed with the task
  contract's own runner budget, strictest value per metric, recomputed from both
  authorities on every read rather than trusted from the record. A run with no
  task contract requires an explicit `contract_less` grant. Wall clock is a
  frozen absolute deadline measured on the store clock, which may not run
  backwards over the run's own durable records. A token or cost limit is
  refused at preflight until provider-attested usage is wired, because a
  self-asserted usage number is worse than no limit. `ProgramAuthorizationV1`
  grants are operator-minted into the account-level harness home and a budget is
  accepted only when its embedded grant resolves to byte-identical stored bytes.
- The automation budget defends against honest-but-buggy controllers and
  transport retries, not against a caller that already has the store's own
  privileges. Three boundaries are explicitly out of scope until their owning
  authority exists: `operation` and `outcome` are caller-asserted until the
  unattended controller binds them to real side effects; reconciliation
  `evidence_refs` are shape-checked typed refs, presence-checked but not
  content-verified, until a digest-addressed provider usage and attempt-receipt
  authority can resolve them; and the store's clock seam is a test-only
  convenience rather than a permission boundary, because a same-process caller
  is already trusted at the process level. Replaying an idempotency key charges
  once, an interrupted reservation blocks further spending until it is
  reconciled from exact evidence rather than assumed free -- and once a
  reconciliation decision is recorded, only that decision may charge the
  reservation. A projection that counts durable records the disk does not have
  is corruption, not a crash window: every verb and every read surface fails
  closed without writing anything. Exhaustion
  publishes an immutable `AutomationStopReceiptV1`. A budget never raises or
  renews itself, never rewrites Task, Lease, Work Graph, or contract authority,
  and never releases or steals a claim.

- One unattended controller is bound to the exact automation budget run,
  Engineer principal, Binding generation, authorization revision, and protected
  path set. Each invocation has independent hard step and duration ceilings.
  Acquisition is only through canonical `acquire-next`; execution consumes its
  returned `WorkEnvelopeV1` and dispatches only an already-admitted run through
  `dispatchDelegatedRun`. The controller never creates Task, Work Graph, Lease,
  or delegated-run authority.
- Controller events are append-only evidence under the Git common directory.
  The event is durable before every acquisition or dispatch; a restart at an
  unresolved side-effect boundary becomes `reconciliation_required` and cannot
  repeat that side effect. Transient acquisition failures use recorded,
  deterministic exponential backoff capped by the frozen policy; user/operator
  blockers and budget exhaustion are terminal. Explicit stop prevents another
  acquisition and leaves the current Claim and Lease to their normal owner.

## Workflow Surfaces

| Surface | Owner | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `repo-harness run <helper>` | Package runtime | Canonical workflow helper execution |
| `repo-harness state next --json` | Package runtime | Canonical pull-based continuation entry: a read-only projection returning one unit or one halt per tick, byte-identical for identical repo bytes and identical attempt-ledger bytes |
| `docs/spec.md` | Maintainers | Stable product intent and safety boundary |
| `plans/prds/`, `plans/sprints/`, `plans/plan-*.md` | Planner | Decision-complete work packages |
| `tasks/contracts/*.contract.md` | Implementer | Allowed paths, delegation, and exit criteria |
| `tasks/reviews/*.review.md` | Evaluator | Human Review Card, evidence, risk, acceptance |
| `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json` | Verifier | Current structured gate result |
| `.ai/harness/runs/*.json` | Verifier | Immutable run/trace snapshots |
| `.ai/harness/handoff/` | Session owner | Resume packets and exact next step |
| `repo-harness automation budget show --run <id>` | Package runtime | Read-only operator projection of one automation run's budget, consumption, and stop receipt |
| `repo-harness automation budget repair --run <id>` | Package runtime | Operator re-run of the locked reconciliation so a stopped or expired run seals its exhaustion receipt; it reserves, charges and re-caps nothing |
| `repo-harness automation controller start\|step\|status\|stop\|reconcile` | Package runtime | Bounded unattended Engineer orchestration over the existing budget, acquire-next, WorkEnvelope and delegated-run authorities |
| `docs/reference-configs/ux-feature-guard.md`, `docs/reference-configs/design-options.md`, `.claude/templates/design-brief.template.md` | Conventions | Frontend behavior discipline: freeze rules and non-goals before implementation, product boundary before imagegen variants, taste-class refinement ceiling, role-aware visible-concept declaration; `frontend` task_profile contracts must cite a design brief, and the runtime `[UXFeatureGuard]` advisory fires only on frontend-scoped feature intent |

## Safety Boundaries

- Hook logic is a guardrail and context accelerator; it must not silently make
  product decisions, merge work, publish releases, or bypass review.
- External knowledge and memory are advisory. Current repo files and live check
  output override summaries.
- Delegated work remains parent-owned: explorer and verifier are read-only;
  worker edits are constrained to contract `allowed_paths`.
- Collaboration remains an untrusted knowledge plane: signals, context packets
  and handoff adoption cannot acquire a Claim, move a Lease, publish or accept.
  The C9 live gate keeps one writer, records exact provider JSONL usage, and
  requires repeated evidence before any persistent same-capability seat can be
  proposed.
- A Module Engineer binding is shared git-common-dir authorization state for
  engineer-scoped commands only. It cannot create, transfer, or replace task
  Lease, Publication, Acceptance, or merge authority.
- Engineer binding transitions publish an immutable idempotency-fenced event
  before CAS-replacing the sole current pointer. Dangling events remain audit
  evidence only; retries cannot select by time, change payload under one key,
  or fabricate current state after a crash.
- Engineer identity is derived by an authenticated runtime boundary; an LLM may
  not gain authority by supplying `engineer_id` or binding generation as command
  arguments.
- One claimed worktree has at most one writer actor, including the parent
  Engineer itself. A writable delegated worker must hold an independently
  enforced child grant and settle it before publication. Writable delegation
  is available only when a Worker Host controls both Parent and child mutation
  capability; unmanaged Provider Sessions remain read-only.
- Parent freeze, Worker activation, settlement, and Parent restoration are
  separate crash-recoverable writer-slot states. Transitional or unverifiable
  states admit no mutation or publication and never silently restore a writer.
- Provider threads, transcripts, auto memory, and context summaries are caches.
  Durable module knowledge remains in architecture, research, lessons,
  workstreams, and task-local notes, with any engineer memory kept as a
  rebuildable index.
- Agent Runtime adapters are a closed set (`codex-app-thread`,
  `herdr-cli-agent`). They cannot create endpoints, carry message bodies, execute
  generic terminal commands, infer receipt state, or change Task, Lease,
  Collaboration, Publication, Acceptance, or Fleet column authority.

## Human Review Expectations

Human reviewers should start with the task review's `## Human Review Card`,
then inspect the active contract, changed files, latest trace, and failed or
skipped checks. A pass means the reviewer can see what changed, why it is in
scope, what verified it, what risk remains, and how to roll it back.

The card is a reading surface, not an acceptance authority. Closeout requires
canonical `## External Acceptance Advice` with `pass`, bound under Review Rubric
v2 to the normalized final-content review subject and current benchmark evidence.
Machine verification is bounded and consumes frozen evidence; it must not launch
providers, adoption, substantive installation, or benchmark production.

Before semantic review, reviewers use the prepared `ReviewSelectionPacket` to
focus on selected paths, the closed reason set, and declared test/readback oracles.
The packet is bound to the exact final subject and policy target revision; a
reviewer disagreement may escalate it but cannot weaken it. The overlay takes
effect only after a fresh `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance` rebinds it into
canonical evidence; a stale prepared packet cannot finalize. `pattern_novelty`
is driven only by abstraction-shaped additions relative to the policy base.
Release runtime
readback is recorded separately as `RuntimeEvidenceReceipt`, never as a task
AcceptanceReceipt field.

## Acceptance Scenarios

- An existing repo can adopt the harness, generate workflow files, and pass
  `repo-harness run check-task-workflow --strict`.
- A standard downstream init or migration does not create repo-local
  repo-harness helper scripts under `scripts/` or `.ai/harness/scripts/`.
- A sprint row can expand into a plan, contract, notes, review, latest trace,
  and handoff without relying on previous chat.
- A fresh agent session can read source artifacts first and resume from the
  exact next step.
- A maintainer can reject or accept an agent change from the Human Review Card
  plus machine evidence.
- A host loop can drive an approved sprint to completion using only
  `repo-harness state next` output; an interrupted closeout is recoverable
  explicitly without duplicating push or merge; two consecutive no-progress
  turns halt the loop instead of spinning.

## Canonical Terms

- **Plan (work-package)**: A decision-complete `plans/plan-*.md` document
  promoted to work-package level because it needs its own merge, rollback, or
  verification boundary, rather than staying a checklist row in a sprint
  backlog or active plan.
- **Task contract**: The authoritative delegation brief in
  `tasks/contracts/*.contract.md` that fixes allowed paths, exit criteria, and
  scope for one execution slice; an implementer works from the contract, not
  from surrounding chat history.
- **Workstream**: A durable, capability-scoped progress record under
  `tasks/workstreams/<domain>/<capability>/` that carries status across
  sessions and plans instead of living only in chat memory.
- **Capability**: A functional block registered in the capability authority
  selected by `.ai/harness/policy.json#context.capability_source` and resolved
  by longest-prefix path match, owning local agent context and ownership
  boundaries for the files under it.
- **Module Engineer**: A stable logical engineering role that references one
  canonical capability and a reviewed SOP. It is not a Session, task owner,
  Lease, or acceptance identity.
- **Engineer binding**: The current shared, generation-fenced association between
  a Module Engineer and one Agent runtime endpoint. Its contract revision covers
  the canonical Profile bytes, SOP bytes, and capability revision. It authorizes
  only explicitly engineer-scoped runtime commands issued through a trusted
  principal boundary.
- **Agent Runtime effect**: An immutable V2 intent and observation chain that
  fences one subject to one current endpoint and admits at most one closed Host
  action per intent. `notify_inbox` fences one persisted inbox message;
  `wake_for_offer` fences one `EngineerOffersV1` snapshot revision. Reachability
  and delivery are read-model facts, never scheduling or acceptance authority.
- **Task-offer wake**: A durable `wake_for_offer` effect armed from an offer
  snapshot that has been re-proved against the offer authority's own
  whole-document validator and fenced to this repository and the exact current
  Binding, bound to the Engineer Binding generation, repository ID,
  authorization revision, offer snapshot revision and a closed reason. Exactly
  one wake is current per Binding: every wake mutation linearizes on the
  per-Binding wake lock taken before the per-effect lock, a newer snapshot
  supersedes an unstarted one into the terminal `superseded` state inside a
  bounded coalescing window that it inherits rather than extends, and a started
  one is never superseded. The Host action carries no claim token and no
  writable authority, and success requires a controller-step receipt bound to
  the effect control reference — never a message-delivery receipt and never a
  process exit code. Binding, capability and authorization fences are re-read
  after the start becomes durable, so a fence that commits during the start
  yields a recorded failure instead of a stale Host action. A wake is a hint
  that work may exist; the awakened controller re-reads current offers and
  authorization, and a stale or empty snapshot is a no-op, not a claim.
- **Engineer acquire-next**: An idempotent effects operation that reads the
  current `EngineerOffersV1`, selects the first offer in its authoritative
  order under closed filters, constructs the full revision assertion, and
  delegates to the existing scheduled acquire path. Stale selections and lost
  elections may be re-read only within a caller-supplied bound. A persisted
  pending receipt after an uncertain side-effect boundary fails closed as
  reconciliation-required.
- **Dependency authority**: The single read-only resolver that answers one
  declared Work Graph dependency state from the one authority that already owns
  that verdict: the canonical Sprint row for `canonical_done`, the acceptance
  authority's own verification observation for `module_accepted`, the Lease
  publication pointer plus the immutable PublicationReceipt and integration
  observation for `publication_integrated`, and the ME-4C product acceptance
  projection for `product_accepted`. Every branch reads a record-time artifact
  the owning authority published; none of them re-derives a verdict. A readable negative is `unsatisfied`; a missing,
  unreadable, unauthorized or unsupported authority is `authority_unavailable`;
  an unknown authority is never ready. Each observation carries an
  `authority_revision` digest of its canonical validated evidence projection, so
  receipt, target-revision or registry-authorization movement stales the
  Engineer offer that asserted it.
- **Dependency acceptance authority reference**: The closed, revision-bound
  `acceptance_authority` field on a Work Graph dependency edge that names the
  exact acceptance subject for `module_accepted` and `product_accepted`. It is
  validated against the same canonical commit as the target Work Graph;
  `required_acceptance` policy documents cannot select a receipt subject and are
  never used as a substitute.
- **Acceptance verification observation**: The immutable record the acceptance
  authority writes for itself inside the same transaction that records an
  AcceptanceReceipt. It freezes what only that authority can prove — the live
  normalized review subject digest, the verification-evidence fingerprint, the
  contract and goal bindings, the target ref and revision, the disposition, and
  the archive-projection seal digest when one applies. It is keyed by subject
  (`sha256` of the contract file plus its acceptance fingerprint) rather than
  content-addressed, so one contract subject has exactly one current
  observation and re-recording the same subject overwrites it while a changed
  contract lands under a different key. Readers verify identity, canonical
  bytes and the derived observation id; they never recompute the acceptance
  verdict. A dependency edge naming an archive-projected contract is
  fail-closed `authority_unavailable`, because the acceptance fingerprint
  normalizes the archive envelope away and only the authority's own seal can
  distinguish a projected contract from its source.
- **Delegated worker grant**: A non-transferable child mutation permit under one
  current task claim and one exclusive worktree writer slot. It is not a second
  task Lease and cannot authorize publication or acceptance.
- **Task profile**: The declared execution shape of a contract (for example
  `code-change`) that determines which verification and delegation rules
  apply to that task.
- **Refactor Mode**: The `off | shadow | active` operating mode under which
  repo-harness consumes an external structural authority to discover and
  execute refactors. It is a narrowed entry into the existing plan, contract,
  worktree, and ship flow, never a second workflow engine.
- **Proposal Author**: The repo-harness-side agent or human that writes a
  refactor proposal for the external structural authority to assess. The
  author supplies intent, scope, target outcomes, and kill list; it never
  decides the structural scale, the workflow route, or a recommendation's
  status.
- **RefactorWorkflowRoute**: The repo-harness workflow routing decision
  deterministically projected from the external authority's structural scale
  and its evidence reason codes. It may stop more conservatively than the
  upstream scale but may never route below it.
- **Refactor Program**: One authorized Refactor Mode run, holding only the
  bindings from external recommendations to local work packages. It carries no
  recommendation status; every status is re-read from the external authority.
- **Cutover Closure**: The provider-independent gate asserting that every
  declared old implementation, caller, fallback, test, document, and
  compatibility window of a replaced surface has an explicit disposition, and
  that nothing declared removed still exists at the candidate head.
- **Refactor Execution Binding**: The append-only, immutable set of references
  tying one external recommendation to the plan, contract, closure,
  acceptance, and merge evidence of one execution. It has no status field, so
  a merged pull request can never by itself mean the refactor is resolved.
- **Joined Refactor Board**: The read-only projection joining the external
  semantic refactor ledger with local execution evidence. It owns no state and
  is fully rebuildable from its authorities.

## Agent WorkDemand intake authority

An authenticated current Engineer may create a bounded `WorkDemandV1` and submit it for Human review. The immutable request binds its exact Binding generation and contract revision, source and target capabilities, untrusted problem/outcome text, digest-bound resources, and advisory urgency/dependency hints. Messages and external issues may reference the demand but never become its authority.

Only Human authority may accept or reject a submitted demand. Acceptance freezes the exact target Sprint commit, Work Graph revision, stable Task ID, Sprint row bytes, and full `WorkPackageDefinitionV1`. Materialization validates both fences and cross-live-Sprint Task ID uniqueness, constructs the new Sprint and Work Graph as one Git tree, and compare-and-swaps the canonical target ref. Before CAS it durably journals the exact commit and receipt. A pre-CAS crash leaves the ref unchanged; replay after CAS returns the same receipt without another ref mutation. Movement to any other commit fails closed. The receipt can then drive the existing materialized transition; it proves work creation only, and normal offer/acquire remains the sole Claim and Lease path.

## Execution boundary invariants

- Controller dispatch must match the acquired Task/revision, Claim/generation, WorkEnvelope, and Engineer Binding/generation before budget reservation or attempt start.
- Refactor materialization binds every accepted Recommendation payload's baseline, assessment, proposal/author, scale, nodes and major-change reasons to the Program. Later stages consume the immutable materialized Program digest. Full scan provenance (provider stage and scale-reason codes absent from recommendation readback) remains an audit gap, not execution authority.
- Execution bindings consume verifier-persisted receipts and the exact verified PR head. Post-merge evidence measures one exact final-main head; each recorded merge must be its ancestor. Board identity includes that measured head.
- Campaign journal inspection and stop/reconciliation/expiry recording remain available after target movement or grant expiry; they grant no fresh execution authority. Post-merge continuation remains disabled until a typed Campaign-to-owned-publication proof is available. Omitted CLI start timestamps replay the first immutable start definition.
- Live canonical Sprint carriers share one Task ID namespace, including completed rows in a live Sprint. Archived carriers are excluded. Canonical readers and proposed materialization validate the same invariant before shared Lease/message use or publication.

## Persistent Claude acceptance reviewer

`repo-harness claude-review round/status/close/cancel` owns one reviewer session
per canonical task contract and worktree. Both host profiles require usable
herdr >=0.9.0 in readiness. Each review owns a dedicated named headless herdr
server, a readable activity pane and one persistent Claude stream-json child.
A private config and launcher isolate the host from user shell startup and restore.
It does not parse terminal text or change user configuration.

The existing acceptance context owns contract/goal identity, current Git subject,
target revision and prepared verification fingerprint. Each numbered request
freezes these values. The provider returns a closed structured result with exact
round/session/context identities, verdict and stable finding IDs. Host validation
and a fresh context fence precede the existing protected `AcceptanceReceipt`
writer. Raw provider results and receipt associations are transport evidence,
not another acceptance authority. Review Markdown remains a receipt projection.

Initial session creation consumes existing semantic-review admission. Up to three
changed-subject repair rounds retain the same PID/session; each prior finding
must explicitly remain open or become resolved. The read-only provider has only
Read/Grep/Glob tools, no inherited MCP servers, hooks or skills. Unknown delivery,
identity loss, timeout, malformed output, stale evidence or concurrent submission
fails closed without replay or automatic recovery.

After verification passes, explicit `close` checks the current passing receipt
against the session's final recorded round, shuts down the child and its host,
and retains evidence. `cancel` permits owned cleanup after failure without
acceptance. PID/group/start-time/executable and herdr server/session/pane/host
identity fence operations; a reused pane is never a cleanup target. Run close
before `contract-worktree finish` removes the workspace. This reviewer does not
create scheduler Tasks, Claims, Leases or Engineer Bindings; Herdr notification
adapters and the provider-free merge gate keep their existing authority.
