- `calls` → `component.refactor-program.lifecycle` — Execute authorized program transitions and publish only exact lifecycle evidence through the capability-owned effect plane

入向關係:

- 無。

## 3. P3:設計決策與不變量

- No local module statistics, dependency analysis, cycle detection, refactor scoring, or scale inference.
- No copied recommendation status or locally synthesized resolution.
- Materialization re-reads ArchContext lifecycle authority and accepts only exact `recommendationId` + fingerprint pairs whose current status is `accepted`, and binds Program scale, affected nodes, assessment, proposal, baseline and major-change reasons to the complete recommendation payload.
- Every generated Work Package ID must be present in the account-level ProgramAuthorization allowlist.
- Every mutating program transition is append-only, idempotent by exact event identity, and rejected on conflicting replay.
- Candidate worktrees cannot relax the target revision's policy or authorization.
- Architecture-scale work always crosses the existing human architecture-acceptance boundary.
- An architecture approval reference is derived from the complete target delta; the existing projection receipt must bind that reference, the exact affected nodes, and the exact provider major-change reasons.
- Projection-owned architecture file changes join the same Git CAS as the Refactor Program artifacts; the refactor lane never renders architecture docs itself.
- Workflow route is a pure three-input projection of provider-owned scale, scale reason codes, and major-change reasons; a supplied route is accepted only when it equals that projection.
- Materialization never creates a Lease: it writes only Program bindings, canonical Sprint tasks, Work Packages, Plans, and their exact acceptance and rollback references.
- One affected architecture node maps to one Work Package, one rollback boundary, and one repo-scoped concurrency key; dependency topology must validate before the Git CAS.
- A failed CAS leaves the append-only program at `materializing`; replay recognizes only the exact authorized child commit and finishes the `planning` transition idempotently. Execution and verification accept only that durable materialization revision while the grant stays pinned to its original baseline.
- Program bindings may fan one exact recommendation out to multiple Work Packages with a consistent fingerprint/alias and distinct canonical task references. Candidate and execution receipts select that recommendation/task pair.
- Completion requires Cutover Closure plus exact post-merge ArchContext measurement. Multi-task candidate measurements may be partially resolved or unchanged while each task closes its own cutover; stale/regressed candidates fail, and single-task candidates still require resolved.
- Final-main measurement groups every mapped task in Program order and resolves each recommendation once. Board cards expose Work Package/task reference identity and require every mapped execution receipt before projecting recommendation resolution.
- Candidate verification preserves the fixed four-gate order. A closure failure prevents provider and acceptance calls; an unavailable Stage 2 provider is recorded explicitly and never weakens Contract, closure, or AcceptanceReceipt gates.
- Execution bindings contain only immutable references. The PR head must equal the verified candidate; the shared merge predicate proves ancestry or an absorbed squash. Candidate verification is a separate receipt because PR and merge identities do not exist at preverify time; no nullable or lifecycle fields represent a partial binding.
- Program and execution bindings identify recommendations by ID plus fingerprint. Provider resolution evidence has a different opaque recommendation digest and joins by unique recommendation ID after exact recommendation readback. Duplicate authorities fail closed.
- Merge observation alone is `merged_pending_measurement`. A card resolves only when provider evidence binds the exact final-main commit and provider lifecycle readback is `resolved`; every recorded merge must be an ancestor of that final main. A persisted measurement retries an interrupted provider lifecycle write, while stale evidence requires reconciliation and all other non-resolved dispositions require follow-up.
- The public discovery selection binds exact recommendation ID and fingerprint. Git supplies regular-file paths from the scan HEAD to the bounded author; upstream owns the structural interpretation. Board writes reject symlink ancestors.
- Discovery re-reads ArchContext lifecycle state and excludes exact resolved or superseded recommendation identities before assigning candidate aliases.
- Runtime policy is an intent ceiling, not activation evidence: shadow requires the shadow rung, active execution requires `active_module`, and cross-module materialization additionally requires `active_cross_module`.
- Activation events are append-only, advance exactly one rung, and bind the fixed canary receipt subset to the same repository and exact target revision. Architecture intervention retains its independent human approval at every rung.
