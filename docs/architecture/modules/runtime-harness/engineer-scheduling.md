### 1.3 規模信號

- 規模量級:`5–10` 個文件 / `2000–5000` 行
- 匹配前綴:`src/core/engineers/scheduling.ts`、`src/effects/engineers/dependency-authority.ts`、`src/effects/engineers/scheduling.ts`、`src/effects/engineers/scheduling-acquire.ts`、`src/effects/engineers/scheduling-acquire-next.ts`
- 推導:掃描 `source.include` 減 `source.exclude`,跳過 `.git/` 與 `node_modules/`,再按 1–2–5 階梯分桶。精確計數不入本文檔:量級足以回答「這個能力有多大」,而逐行計數會讓覆蓋範圍內任何一次源碼改動都改寫本文檔。

### 1.4 依賴邊界

出向關係:

- `calls` → `capability.runtime-harness.engineer-bindings` — Revalidate the exact current Engineer contract and delegate the elected offer to the existing Engineer acquire authority

入向關係:

- `calls` ← `capability.runtime-harness.collaboration` — Ask the scheduling plane for this exact authenticated principal's own offers, so a Work Exchange snapshot reports what the plane answered rather than defaulting an empty list
- `depends_on` ← `capability.runtime-harness.development-campaign` — Reserve the existing Work Graph and acquire chain as the only later campaign execution path
- `calls` ← `capability.runtime-harness.interface-change` — Verify target-Engineer materialization against the exact tracked ME-1A Work Graph projection at one Git commit
- `calls` ← `capability.runtime-harness.mcp-sidecar` — Project and acquire exact revision-fenced Engineer offers for a verified OAuth principal
- `calls` ← `capability.runtime-harness.work-demand` — Validate the accepted Work Package against the same-commit canonical Sprint and Work Graph

## 3. P3:設計決策與不變量

- Canonical Sprint rows remain the only Task identity authority. The deterministic same-commit `.work-graph.v1.json` sibling owns scheduling metadata and derived Work Package revisions without changing `task_id` or `task_revision`.
- Missing carrier means `unclassified`; `generic-v1` is explicit and has zero Work Packages. `engineering-v2` has exact full Sprint-row coverage and no unknown semantic keys.
- Offers bind graph, Work Package, Task, Profile, Binding, Fleet offer, dependency, concurrency, and authorization observations. An offer grants no authority and any changed observation makes it stale.
- Repository concurrency is elected by one Git-common-dir lock held across final revalidation and the existing synchronous Engineer/Fleet acquire call. ME-1A creates no second Claim, Lease, assignment, or rollback authority.
- Every declared dependency state resolves through one closed read-only resolver (`src/effects/engineers/dependency-authority.ts`) against the authority that already owns that verdict: canonical Sprint row, exact-subject AcceptanceReceipt, Lease publication pointer plus immutable PublicationReceipt and integration observation, ME-4C product acceptance projection. A readable negative is `unsatisfied`; a missing, unreadable, unauthorized or unsupported authority is `authority_unavailable`. Scheduling never reconstructs acceptance, publication or product state from prose, paths, branch names, Git topology, or compatibility heuristics.
- `required_acceptance` carries acceptance policy documents, not receipt subjects, so a dependency edge that requires an acceptance verdict names its own closed `acceptance_authority` reference. That reference is revision-bound and proven against the same canonical commit as the target Work Graph before any authority read; a stale declaration is `authority_unavailable`, never a pass.
- `authority_revision` is the digest of the canonical validated evidence projection for one observation, so a moved receipt, target revision, or registry authorization changes the dependency revision and stales the Engineer offer that asserted it. Cross-repository dependencies resolve only through the current adopted read-write registry snapshot; a repository path is never taken from Work Graph text.
- `acquire-next` consumes the offer document's existing order directly, constructs the exact assertion internally, and delegates to the ordinary scheduled acquire path. Its Git-common-dir receipt binds principal, closed filters, attempt bound, and result to one idempotency key; a pending receipt after a crash requires reconciliation rather than risking another claim.

At 10x scale, full registry/profile/receipt scans and lock hold time fail first. P0 deliberately keeps those costs linear and observable; no index, daemon, cache, or database is introduced before measurements justify a separate work-package.

## 4. 歷史決策記錄(append-only)

- 2026-08-25: Human approved `changeset.plan-20260825-1149-me1a-engineer-scheduling-schema` via `event.review-20260825-1149-me1a-engineer-scheduling-schema-approval`. The fixed-point projection proves the exact `delegateScheduledEngineerAcquire` → `acquireEngineerTask` selector and the MCP → scheduling capability boundary.
