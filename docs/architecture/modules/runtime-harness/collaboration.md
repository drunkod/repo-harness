Publishes append-only coordination signals, work-state handoffs, non-exclusive adoption receipts and delegated-Worker contribution commits over one shared create-once store substrate, enforces the parent Engineer's delegation policy at admission time as a pre-step to the existing read-only delegation, and reads that substrate back into one collaborative Work Exchange snapshot and one bounded context packet whose delivery into a delegated run is fenced by a required run-context binding, with Host-derived identity and recorded time and zero Task, Lease, Publication or Acceptance authority.

### 1.3 規模信號

- 規模量級:`20–50` 個文件 / `5000–10000` 行
- 匹配前綴:`src/core/collaboration/**`、`src/effects/collaboration/**`、`src/cli/commands/collaboration.ts`
- 推導:掃描 `source.include` 減 `source.exclude`,跳過 `.git/` 與 `node_modules/`,再按 1–2–5 階梯分桶。精確計數不入本文檔:量級足以回答「這個能力有多大」,而逐行計數會讓覆蓋範圍內任何一次源碼改動都改寫本文檔。

### 1.4 依賴邊界

出向關係:

- `calls` → `capability.runtime-harness.bound-task-freezes` — Prove a handoff's bound_task execution context against the persisted TaskFreeze receipt it names, on publish and again on every read, so a caller-supplied Claim and Lease generation is never projected as a fact
- `calls` → `capability.runtime-harness.delegated-runs` — Enforce the parent Engineer's delegation policy as a pre-step to the unchanged read-only admission, and turn one run's persisted output into a contribution the delegation plane's own WorkerResult then references
- `calls` → `capability.runtime-harness.engineer-bindings` — Derive the publishing actor from the authenticated principal and current Binding instead of accepting a declared identity
- `calls` → `capability.runtime-harness.engineer-scheduling` — Ask the scheduling plane for this exact authenticated principal's own offers, so a Work Exchange snapshot reports what the plane answered rather than defaulting an empty list
- `calls` → `component.collaboration.primary` — Persist immutable coordination signals under a per-thread lock without writing any delivery store

入向關係:

- `calls` ← `capability.runtime-harness.delegated-runs` — Run the collaboration dispatch fence inside the read-only dispatch effect itself, before any host action, refusing a run whose injected coordination context no binding accounts for
- `depends_on` ← `capability.runtime-harness.development-campaign` — Reserve the existing fenced delegated-run boundary as the only later campaign dispatch path
- `calls` ← `capability.runtime-harness.mcp-sidecar` — Serve the bounded Engineer collaboration tool set from the shared agent surface, deriving the author from the authenticated authorization and taking no actor, destination or recorded time from a caller

  p2_collaboration_50c48bca->>p2_collaboration_store_5c827af5: Reject an undeclared key on the wire before publishing， so an identity claim is refused with the field named rather than silently dropped
  p2_collaboration_50c48bca->>p2_collaboration_store_5c827af5: Record adoption as an identity statement that grants no Task， Claim or Lease， so distinct adopters never exclude one another

  else A dispatch carrying injected coordination context that no binding accounts for is refused before the host action
  p2_collaboration_50c48bca->>p2_collaboration_store_5c827af5: Decide from Host-owned state whether this dispatch is a collaboration dispatch， treating a persisted binding and an untrusted marker in the goal as equally sufficient

## 3. P3:設計決策與不變量

### 兩個平面,一個方向

交付平面(Work Graph → EngineerOffer → Claim/Lease → WorkEnvelope → Publication
→ Acceptance)是權威。協作平面只讀它,永不寫它,也沒有一條反向邊。這條邊界由
C0 的 D1 凍結,由 `tests/unit/collaboration-authority-baseline.test.ts` 守住:
封閉掃描證明本能力不在五個被凍結的平面上,另一條斷言證明任何交付平面模組都沒有
import 協作模組。

Child PRD A 記的核心風險是「協作 store 退化成第二個調度器」。防線不是文檔約定,
而是這條 import 方向斷言加上 store 本身零交付寫入的 before/after digest 證據。

### 記錄時間為什麼是一個判別聯合

signal 的 `created_at` 由 Host 派生,且對重試穩定。兩種來源各自對應一條真實的
provenance 鏈:delegated 貢獻取該次運行精確的持久化觀測時間,直接發布在第一次
idempotency 事件裡凍結時鐘。用一組可空欄位表達會允許「兩個都為 null」這種無意義
狀態,所以它是判別聯合。

真正的壓力點在重試路徑:先採樣時鐘再查存在性,會讓一次冪等重試看起來像 payload
衝突。store 因此只在建檔那條分支讀時鐘,比較分支一律用已持久化的值重建候選。

### 身份只能由服務端派生

publish 的入參裡根本沒有 actor 欄位。actor 由 `resolveEngineerPrincipal()` 從
authenticated principal 推導,再對 principal mapping 做第二次讀取,兩次不一致就
fail closed。呼叫方自述的身份不是被忽略,而是無處可寫。

P0 的 wire union 只有 `module_engineer` 與 `delegated_worker`,因為只有這兩類有
不可變的服務端 provenance。`human_operator` 與 `native_subagent` 不進 union,也
不留佔位分支——留下的佔位分支遲早會被填上一個沒有 provenance 的值。

### supersede 的 lineage 邊界

append-only 的修訂只能是 supersede,而 supersede 只能在同一個 actor lineage 內。
lineage 對 Module Engineer 取 `engineer_id`,對 delegated Worker 取
`worker_run_ref_sha256`:重新綁定是同一個持久 Engineer 的換屆,兩次 delegated run
則是兩個參與者。

### 10x 規模下先壞的地方

per-thread lock 讓同一條 thread 的寫入串行。單一 thread 上的高頻寫入會先撞到鎖等待,
而不是磁碟。thread 之間互不阻塞,所以擴展方向是 thread 的數量而不是單 thread 的吞吐。
`listCoordinationSignals()` 是全量掃描,C2 的投影需要它時要綁定來源集合的 digest,
且快取永遠不能成為權威。

### 不變量

- 協作平面對 Task、Lease、Publication、Acceptance 的字節影響為 0。
- 每條 signal 一個不可變檔案,身份級原子寫,同 id 同 payload 冪等、不同 payload 顯式衝突。
- store 不可讀時 fail loud,絕不退化成健康空集。
- `collaboration.mode` 預設 `off`,升級順序 `off -> shadow -> active`,不跳級。
- `src/core/collaboration/common.ts` 在 C1 之後凍結,C2-C9 只消費不修改。

## 4. 歷史決策記錄(append-only)

| 日期 | 決策 | 依據 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-08-29 | 建立 `capability.runtime-harness.collaboration`,協作平面與交付平面分離 | `docs/researches/20260829-c0-collaboration-two-plane-authority-freeze.md` D1-D12 |
| 2026-08-29 | `ArtifactRefV1` 複用 `WorkerResultV1.evidence_refs` 的同一個校驗器,不引入第二個等價引用類型 | D8;`src/core/engineers/delegation.ts` 的 `validateWorkerEvidenceRefs()` |
| 2026-08-29 | store 根、鎖策略與 canonical JSON 複用既有 `repo-harness/<domain>/v1` 慣例與既有鎖原語,不寫第二個序列化器 | D9 |

## Optimization Backlog

- C2 的 thread/hotspot 投影如果需要快取,快取必須綁定來源集合的 digest 並在不匹配時重算。
- 目前 `listCoordinationSignals()` 讀全量;真實 signal 量級由 C9 的 canary 測出來之後再決定要不要分片。
