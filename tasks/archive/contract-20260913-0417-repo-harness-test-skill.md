## Why

Testing technique in this repository is currently spread across commit messages,
archived notes, and the reading of a few helper files. The prose policy in
`docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md#testing-policy-and-artifact-standards`
deliberately owns only author/reviewer requirements, not the repo-specific
mechanics (which fixture, which runner, which env gate, which CI lane). Without
a router, an agent either re-derives those mechanics wrongly or a second policy
gets written next to the first one.

## Goal

Ship `repo-harness-test` as a canonical skill package: a router `SKILL.md` under
2048 bytes plus four references (`authoring`, `running`, `refactor-evidence`,
`verification-plan`), registered once in `assets/skill-commands/manifest.json` as
a `full`-profile facade so the install/update host sync projects it to both hosts. Every
technique claim in the references resolves to a real file, symbol, command, or
merged PR on `origin/main`. The package restates no policy.

## Scope

- In scope: the new package under `assets/skills/repo-harness-test/`; one package
  entry plus the `expectedProjections.facadesByProfile.full` row in
  `assets/skill-commands/manifest.json`; adding the package name to the
  manifest-derived surface inventories that act as the drift checks between the
  manifest and the declared surface; one routing row in
  `assets/reference-configs/agentic-development-flow.md` and its projection.
- Out of scope: any change to the testing policy prose in `sprint-contracts.md`;
  any change to `src/`; any change to the semantics of an existing assertion;
  README locale tables; `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`.
- Taste constraints: the router names entrypoints and boundaries only; every
  reference stays under roughly 120 lines and cites file:line or a command.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

If the references end up restating `sprint-contracts.md` rather than adding
repo-specific mechanics, the package is a second policy and must not ship.
Cheapest proof point: every normative sentence in a reference should name a
path, symbol, flag, environment variable, or PR that exists in this repository;
a sentence that would read identically in any repository belongs to the policy,
not here.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear as a `package_test` check in Verification Plan).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/archive/plan-20260913-0258-repo-harness-test-skill.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260913-0417-repo-harness-test-skill.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/archive/notes-20260913-0417-repo-harness-test-skill.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Exit Criteria (Machine Verifiable)

This block contains only non-executable artifact requirements. Define every
executable check once in the canonical Verification Plan below. Each check must
state its phase, cost, evidence policy, necessity, and input environment; a
missing or malformed plan fails closed. Populate artifact requirements only
for deliverables this task actually owns; do not create a spec, notes or report
merely to fill this template.

```yaml

  files_exist:
    - assets/skills/repo-harness-test/SKILL.md
    - assets/skills/repo-harness-test/references/authoring.md
    - assets/skills/repo-harness-test/references/running.md

```

Author the actual checks using [Testing Policy and Artifact Standards](../../docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md#testing-policy-and-artifact-standards).
The empty array is not permission to omit required repository checks: retain it
only when no executable criterion applies and explain why in Acceptance Notes.
Prefer existing covering tests; creating a task-named test or adding typecheck
is not a template requirement. For each selected check declare `id`, `kind`,
`cwd`, `phase`, `cost`, `evidence_policy`, `necessity`, `inputs.env`, and its
`command` or `path`. Declare the same execution once, including checks nested
inside aggregate scripts. Use `baseline_with_delta` only with an immutable
baseline and named current delta checks; never infer it from paths or command text.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Changed behavior/boundary: one new shipped skill package plus its single
  manifest registration. The behavior that can break is catalog parsing,
  profile projection, and host sync; all three already have owning tests.
- New test case/file rationale: none added. The new package is declared into the
  existing manifest-derived inventories, which is what gives it coverage; a
  task-named test file would be a second oracle for the same manifest.
- Selected check IDs: `t-canonical-packages` (package shape), `t-catalog` +
  `t-routing-eval` (manifest-derived selectors), `t-action-command-skills`
  (exact facade inventory), `t-install-profiles` + `t-installed-copy-sync`
  (installer and host projection), `t-readme-dx` + `t-retired-names`
  (documentation surfaces), plus the required repository integrity commands.
- Full/expensive check justification: none. No `cost: expensive` check is
  declared. The change touches `assets/` and four test inventory lists; the
  affected consumers are named above, and the PR's own CI run is the full pass
  for the merge candidate.
- Execution/baseline references: recorded in the review file for this contract.
- Residual risks: none outstanding. `REPO_HARNESS_TEST_EXPENSIVE` landed on
  `main` as `268c973d` before this branch was rebased, so every claim in the
  references resolves against `origin/main`.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: `origin/main` at `e3b93f0f` (branch base).
- Revert strategy: revert the single commit on `codex/repo-harness-test-skill`;
  the change adds one package directory and one manifest entry, so removing both
  plus the four inventory rows restores the previous surface exactly.
