## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: external-source binding protocol/effects/store/CLI, focused tests, architecture/reference docs, and exact workflow artifacts.
- Actual files changed: `src/core/external-sources/binding.ts`, `src/effects/external-sources/{binding,store}.ts`, `src/cli/commands/external-source.ts`, focused tests, ArchContext projections, reference docs, and this work package's workflow artifacts.
- Commands passed: focused tests (59/59), `bun run check:type`, full suite (3620 pass, 2 platform skips, 0 fail), and every root Required Check.
- Residual risks: append-only binding projections scan all observations/receipts; at 10x record volume, read latency is the first expected limit. No mutable index is introduced without measurement.
- Reviewer action required: inspect the PR diff and merge only if the Issue-evidence-versus-canonical-authority boundary is acceptable.
- Rollback: revert the single WP2 commit/PR; stored binding receipts remain inert because Fleet does not consume them as authority.

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: parent-agent planning with `agent-harness-construction` schema-first contract design.
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: plan `plans/archive/plan-20260901-0205-external-source-binding-wp2.md`, architecture module `docs/architecture/modules/runtime-harness/external-source-intake.md`, and CLI E2E `tests/cli/external-source-binding.test.ts`.
- Root cause or plan evidence: approved work-package plan and contract; this is not a bugfix.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: repository-equivalent Required Checks all passed; typed acceptance is materialized after commit by `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`.
- Commands run: `bun test --timeout 60000`; `bun run check:type`; `bash scripts/check-deploy-sql-order.sh`; `bash scripts/check-architecture-sync.sh`; `bash scripts/check-task-sync.sh`; `repo-harness run check-task-workflow --strict`; `bun scripts/inspect-project-state.ts --repo . --format text`; `bun src/cli/index.ts init --repo . --dry-run`.
- Manual checks: diff inspected for strict create-once conflict behavior, deterministic retry bytes, provider-content framing, and absence of TaskOffer/Claim/Lease/WorkEnvelope writes.
- Supporting artifacts: focused protocol/store/effect/CLI tests and ArchContext fixed-point projection.
- Implementation notes reviewed: `tasks/archive/notes-20260901-0439-external-source-binding-wp2.md`.
- Run snapshot: `.ai/harness/runs/` and `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json` after acceptance preparation.

- Summary: Exact external-source binding preserves canonical Fleet authority; deterministic protocol, store, drift, untrusted-context, and CLI bridge evidence passed.
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Before: GitHub Issue observations were immutable inert evidence with no audited link to local task identity.
- After: one eligible immutable observation revision can be bound to one exact pending canonical task revision plus Approved plan/contract proof; `bindings` exposes live drift and `context` exposes provider text only inside an untrusted boundary.
- Unchanged: Fleet reads canonical sprint/plan/contract and remains the sole TaskOffer/acquire/Lease/WorkEnvelope path.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Binding is deliberately not discovery-to-plan synthesis: a canonical sprint row and Approved plan/contract must already exist. Automating that semantic transformation requires a separate reviewed work package.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 10/10 | Exact bind, drift, untrusted context, strict storage, and Fleet bridge are covered end to end. |
| Product depth | 9/10 | Completes the evidence-to-board provenance seam while preserving the canonical execution chain. |
| Design quality | 10/10 | One append-only edge schema; no second scheduler, compatibility fallback, or mutable index. |
| Code quality | 10/10 | Closed validators, canonical bytes, deterministic retries, strict conflicts, focused negative tests. |

## Failing Items

- None.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: the commands listed under Verification Evidence.
- Re-check: create a fixture observation, bind it, read `bindings`, then confirm `fleet offers` still reports the canonical task as `execution_ready` without reading the binding as authority.

## Summary

- Pass. WP2 adds a provenance bridge from immutable provider evidence to canonical Task Board identity and leaves all dispatch authority in the existing Fleet path.
