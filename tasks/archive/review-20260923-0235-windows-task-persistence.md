## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pending
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: five production persistence files, three existing test suites and workflow/research artifacts plus the deterministic architecture manifest within the contract.
- Actual files changed: the source diff against pinned base `271f4d31` stays within the contract, including the deterministic architecture manifest.
- Check IDs and evidence disposition: full hosted CI passed on `e3d86d480fb09a96a670243fd1a3aa8b018e97c3`; canonical Verification Plan passed 16/16 (28/28 total criteria) in run-20260923T014911-15248-20260923-0031-windows-task-persistence.json.
- Residual risks: Windows directory power-loss durability is not POSIX-equivalent; the upstream P2 is corrected in `271f4d31`; all canonical and native checks pass, while exact owner acceptance remains pending.
- Reviewer action required: the single independent review is consumed; resolve the upstream P2 and obtain owner acceptance on the final corrected subject.
- Rollback: revert this package while retaining upstream `6167e895`; canonical stored records are unchanged.

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: approved bugfix work-package in an isolated worktree.
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: the active plan traces Binding → Principal → Lease → ClaimActor → delivery/ACK/reply and preserves each existing authority.
- Root cause or plan evidence: contract Root Cause Evidence, original native failure log and Principal pre-fix regression are retained under `.ai/harness/runs/windows-task-persistence/`.

## Verification Evidence

Follow [Testing Policy and Artifact Standards](../../docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md#testing-policy-and-artifact-standards).
Consume canonical evidence; do not rerun checks to populate this review or
copy the executable plan. Return missing/stale evidence to its execution owner.

- Independent semantic review: consumed via codex-plugin on subject `sha256:c34055e0e40205783e955c94f78760c72a39d510ad30bf8eb1b7ef8e0309d7ff`, base origin/main at `0d4371c3`. Verdict needs-attention, one P2: rollback leaves a prepared forward receipt that blocks a fresh upgrade after new v1 history. The provider advisory PASS mapping is not treated as acceptance. The correction is integrated from upstream `271f4d31`; the original reviewed subject is retained as historical evidence.
- Hosted execution: [CI 35759847282](https://github.com/Ancienttwo/repo-harness/actions/runs/35759847282), exact source head `e3d86d480fb09a96a670243fd1a3aa8b018e97c3`, passed Governance, full Test, Windows, macOS, Linux and Required / CI. The documentation lane was skipped by CI selection and is not counted as a pass.
- Windows job `106854943539`: 206 pass, 6 existing platform-specific skips, 0 fail across 15 files. Actual deep-path delivery/ACK/reply, exact-ID migration guards, staging expiry, scan/byte limits and process-exit recovery passed. The event-published recovery case took 22.85 seconds, confirming the former 20-second outer test limit was insufficient on this runner.
- Native logs and structured run readback: `.ai/harness/runs/windows-task-persistence/native-final.log` and `native-final-run.json`.
- Historical failures: native runs `35755604887` and `35756978653` remain failed; their logs and the corrected fixture/identity boundaries are recorded in the research and notes. They are not reclassified as passes.
- Canonical preparation: the earlier attempt stopped before contract checks because current CodeGraph proof was unavailable. The owner authorized the local index; deterministic projection updated only the manifest. Reconciliation receipt `sha256:6ce967e4814bba66a15ddc07b8d4ae528a52483ebdf7b862b132177056228bf2` leaves zero unresolved candidates. Canonical preparation then passed all 16 checks.
- Source verification and rollback base: `6167e895`, containing the upstream exact-stat correction. Review subject remains selected by policy against `origin/main`.

## Manual Check Evidence

- Not applicable: this contract declares no `manual_checks`. Real Host admission and real-data migration are outside this package; hosted fixture execution is not either of those claims.

- Summary: Owner explicitly approved corrected PR444 subject c21805db55803c9e4430b04ed63d788c55fd2d0bfe5684af7d6c2927c57c5770 after 28/28 canonical criteria and successful full CI35765127664 on source2948a041. The consumed review finding was corrected upstream in271f4d31 with real red/green and native tests. Authorized acceptance, archive and downstream integration; excludes main merge, global install, real migration, Host admission, Campaign and canary.
- Findings: none

## Implementation evidence

Pre-fix Principal restriction test:4 pass,1 fail with EBADF at the read-only flush handle, PRE_FIX_EXIT=1; post-fix5/5 passed. Owning Binding, Principal, Lease and protected Task reply suites passed118/118 with568 assertions in92.65seconds; typecheck passed. These are local source checks, not Windows native acceptance. Full native CI passed on the integrated source `e3d86d48` as recorded above. Current architecture proof and canonical verification passed on the reviewed candidate. Its independent review returned the upstream P2 above; corrected-source acceptance remains pending.

## Corrected candidate verification

- Source: `2948a041df8e3ecbf2ccecba5e72eb7879229cb6`, retaining upstream source/rollback base `271f4d31`.
- Frozen corrected subject: `sha256:c21805db55803c9e4430b04ed63d788c55fd2d0bfe5684af7d6c2927c57c5770`; target `origin/main` at `0d4371c3`.
- Canonical: 16/16 checks, 28/28 total criteria, run `.ai/harness/runs/run-20260923T020805-38146-20260923-0031-windows-task-persistence.json`.
- Architecture: current local index and deterministic manifest materialization; no semantic model changes.
- Native/full CI: [run `35765127664`](https://github.com/Ancienttwo/repo-harness/actions/runs/35765127664), success on `2948a041`. Governance, Test, Windows, macOS, Linux and Required / CI passed; documentation assertions were skipped. Windows: 210 pass, 6 existing skips, 0 fail across 216 tests/15 files. All four new complete/prefix and foreign/linked prepared-receipt cases passed natively. Logs: `.ai/harness/runs/windows-task-persistence/native-corrected.log` and `native-corrected-run.json`.
- Acceptance remains unavailable. The one independent review is consumed; owner acceptance must bind the corrected candidate after native CI.
