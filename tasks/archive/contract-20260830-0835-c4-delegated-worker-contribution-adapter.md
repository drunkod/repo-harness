## Why

C0 D7 recorded a negative proof: `admitReadOnlyDelegation()` does not consume
`delegation_policy`, so `max_parallel_readers` is today a declared profile value
with no admission-time enforcement. This row is what makes it real. If it ships
wrong the repo either keeps advertising a limit it does not apply, or a bridge
gets smuggled into the existing admission path and D7's proof becomes false.

The contribution collector is the only way a delegated Worker's output becomes
visible collaboration state. If its transaction is not convergent, a retried
collection publishes duplicate signals, two commits, or a synthesized empty
contribution that reads as a successful one.

## Goal

Land `CollaborationDelegationAdmissionV1` as a pre-step bridge that turns
`allowed_roles` and `max_parallel_readers` into runtime constraints, and
`CollaborationContributionDraftV1` / `CollaborationContributionCommitV1` with a
Host collector whose only draft source is the exact persisted stdout of that run.
Prove both against real runtime behaviour, not model-layer assertions.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - `src/core/collaboration/contribution.ts`, `src/core/collaboration/admission.ts`
  - `src/effects/collaboration/admission-bridge.ts`, `provider-output-adapter.ts`,
    `contribution-store.ts`, `contribution-collector.ts`
  - `src/effects/collaboration/actor.ts`: Host-derived `delegated_worker` actor
  - `src/effects/collaboration/signal-store.ts`, `handoff-store.ts`: one
    authorization union so a delegated contribution publishes under its own actor
  - `src/effects/collaboration/record-store.ts`: resolve the carried D9 lock
    deviation and correct the comment that claims compliance
  - the real multi-process admission canary and the fault-injection matrix
  - the architecture surface this row moves: `.archcontext/model/`,
    `docs/architecture/`, the controlled `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` blocks, and the
    AXR7 / e2e count pins in `tests/architecture-projection-e2e.test.ts`
  - `docs/researches/20260829-c0-collaboration-two-plane-authority-freeze.md`
    ledger entry for the D9 deviation
- Out of scope:
  - CollaborationRunContextBinding and context-packet wiring (C6)
  - CLI and MCP surfaces (C7); Operator collaboration view (C8)
  - succession and TaskFreeze integration (C5)
  - any `DelegationEnvelopeV1` protocol bump or `max_turns` relaxation
  - editing `admitReadOnlyDelegation()` or its input shape
- Taste constraints: no second `*_PROTOCOL` for the collaboration plane; reuse
  `record-store.ts` and `common.ts` rather than copying their mechanics.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

The direction is wrong if the bridge cannot reject a real fourth concurrent
request without also changing `admitReadOnlyDelegation()`. Cheapest proof point:
run four independent OS processes against one parent claim and one round index
with `max_parallel_readers = 3` and assert exactly three admissions, one
`max_parallel_readers_exceeded` rejection, and byte-identical
`src/effects/engineers/delegated-run-store.ts`.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260830-0509-c4-delegated-worker-contribution-adapter.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260830-0509-c4-delegated-worker-contribution-adapter.review.md`

- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.
