## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass by typed owner waiver after the single external semantic review rejected the prior metric implementation
- Change type: code-change + delegated-run + durable research/release evidence
- Intended files changed: C9 live canary, provider JSONL boundary, delegated-run evidence limits, deterministic tests, decision report and release documentation
- Actual files changed: the reviewed C7-C9 integration subject listed in the AcceptanceReceipt; C9's owning implementation is `scripts/c9-collaboration-canary.ts`, its unit/effects coverage and its research/release projections
- Commands passed: all 18 contract criteria, including the real live canary, targeted unit/effects suites, full `bun test --timeout 60000`, typecheck, Operator build, architecture/task sync, project inspection and init dry-run
- Residual risks: real-provider latency and output remain stochastic; the evidence does not justify persistent Engineer seats, Review marketplace authority or guarded Merge authority
- Reviewer action required: none; owner waiver is recorded as `user_waiver`, not external PASS
- Rollback: revert the C9 commits on `codex/c7-c9-collaboration-integration`; no state migration or authority-schema rollback is required

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: contract-bound code change with live-provider runtime readback and deterministic repository verification
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: `docs/researches/20260830-c9-real-multi-agent-canary.md`
- Root cause or plan evidence: external review proved that local adoption timing and a hard-coded writer count did not measure the claimed invariants; the final implementation measures a real successor completion and persisted Module Engineer lineages

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: acceptance-equivalent `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, 18 passed and 0 failed
- Commands run: see `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`; the full repository suite passed in 1,199,191 ms and the final live canary passed in 582,864 ms
- Manual checks: external review findings were traced to the two metric sources, corrected and covered by deterministic tests; the provider review budget then correctly failed closed and required owner acceptance
- Supporting artifacts: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`, the immutable AcceptanceReceipt and `docs/researches/20260830-c9-real-multi-agent-canary.md`
- Implementation notes reviewed: `tasks/notes/20260830-1839-c9-real-multi-agent-canary-and-multi-seat-decision.notes.md`
- Run snapshot: `.ai/harness/runs/run-20260830T213725-56035-20260830-1839-c9-real-multi-agent-canary-and-multi-seat-decision.json`

- Summary: Contract owner accepts the final C9 implementation after the external reviewer rejected the prior restart and writer metrics, both findings were corrected, and final verification passed 18 of 18 criteria.
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Treatment runs now continue an adopted handoff through an admitted, bound, real read-only successor and require that successor to publish a useful contribution.
- `handoff_restart_ms` is successor useful-completion time minus the last predecessor completion; `time_to_first_adopted_ms` remains the adoption observation time.
- `writer_max` is the number of distinct persisted Module Engineer actor lineages observed across signals, handoffs and adoption receipts; the decision gate requires exactly one.
- Three frozen matched cases pass C9-A/C9-B, while the repeated restart-bottleneck condition fails and therefore keeps `EngineerSeatV2`, Phase 5 and Phase 6 inactive.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Provider variance can move absolute token and latency values, but cannot change the frozen gate without a fresh full matrix.
- Signal selection remains the measured pressure point: treatment consumed 3.51x input tokens and left 75% of produced signals unread.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 10/10 | All frozen C9-A/C9-B invariants and 18 contract criteria pass |
| Product depth | 9/10 | Produces a bounded no-go decision from real provider evidence rather than promoting unproven seats |
| Design quality | 9/10 | Reuses the admitted dispatch, context binding and persisted actor authorities without introducing a second writer surface |
| Code quality | 9/10 | Metric semantics are explicit and regression-covered; provider stochasticity remains intentionally outside deterministic tests |

## Failing Items

- None. The prior external P1 findings are fixed; acceptance is explicitly an owner waiver because the one-review budget was exhausted.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `REPO_HARNESS_DIFF_BASE=f8c63a7adb9b73a687501a7e36336797305398b1 repo-harness run verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance --contract tasks/contracts/20260830-1839-c9-real-multi-agent-canary-and-multi-seat-decision.contract.md`
- Re-check: verify the resulting live report preserves one writer lineage, unchanged authority/worktree digests and the frozen three-case decision gate

## Summary

- C9 is accepted by the named contract owner against the exact verified subject. The final canary proves reusable read-only collaboration without authority drift, but does not prove that persistent Engineer seats improve the repeated handoff bottleneck.
