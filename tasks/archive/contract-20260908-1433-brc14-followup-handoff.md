## Why

Preserve audit follow-ups through authorized groups and record the required terminal outcome.

## Goal

Next-group authoring consumes the exact previous accepted audit findings, and the final verified disposition determines the canonical completed or completed_with_followups state.

## Scope

- In scope: canonical campaign completion state, validated prior-audit context, initial/continuation prompt and focused regression coverage.
- Out of scope: active admission, real provider calls, GitHub writes, budget resets, main merge and whole BRC acceptance.
- Taste constraints: <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

What observable evidence would prove this task's direction wrong, and the cheapest proof point to check first. Leave as-is if not applicable.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear as a `package_test` check in Verification Plan).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/archive/plan-20260908-1425-brc14-followup-handoff.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260908-1433-brc14-followup-handoff.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/archive/notes-20260908-1433-brc14-followup-handoff.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Change Assessment

```json
{"protocol":1,"oracles":[{"id":"followup-lifecycle","kind":"deterministic_test","paths":["*"]}]}
```

## Acceptance Policy

```json
{"protocol":2,"reviewer":"Codex","source":"codex-review","user_waiver":"allowed"}
```

## Allowed Paths

```yaml
allowed_paths:
  - src/
  - tests/
  - docs/
  - .archcontext/
  - AGENTS.md
  - CLAUDE.md
  - plans/
  - tasks/
```

## Evidence Requirements

```yaml
evidence_requirements:
  # Set benchmark to required when this contract consumes the harness profile benchmark matrix.
  benchmark: not_applicable
```

## Delegation Contract

```yaml
delegation:
  budget:
    tokens: null
    runner_invocations: null
    wall_time_minutes: null
  permission_scope:
    mode: inherit_allowed_paths
    writable_paths: []
    network: inherited
  roles:
    parent:
      mode: narrate_and_gatekeep
      purpose: approval_checkpoint_owner
    explorer:

      purpose: codebase_research
    worker:
      mode: edit_within_allowed_paths
      purpose: implementation
    verifier:
      mode: read_only
      purpose: exit_criteria_review
  runner:
    preferred:
      - subagent
    fallback: null
    brief_is_authoritative: true
```

## Exit Criteria (Machine Verifiable)

This block contains only non-executable artifact requirements. Define every
executable check once in the canonical Verification Plan below. Each check must
state its phase, cost, evidence policy, necessity, and input environment; a
missing or malformed plan fails closed.

```yaml
exit_criteria:
  files_exist:
    - docs/spec.md
  artifacts_exist:
    - .ai/harness/checks/latest.json
    - tasks/archive/notes-20260908-1433-brc14-followup-handoff.md
```

This is the sole executable verification authority. Use `baseline_with_delta`
only when a referenced immutable baseline plus named current delta checks prove
the intended coverage; do not infer that choice from paths or command text.
