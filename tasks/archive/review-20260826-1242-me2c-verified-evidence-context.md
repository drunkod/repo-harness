## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: ME-2C schemas, exact Contract projection, immutable evidence/decision store, bounded CLI, focused tests, PRD/research, workstream and ArchContext projections
- Actual files changed: closed proposal/round/assertion/decision/context records; exact tracked Contract catalog projection; candidate-bound unique-chain compiler; delegated-run/evidence byte revalidation; crash-safe DecisionRequest event/current state; CLI; verified-context capability model and inventory counts
- Commands passed: focused ME-2C/contract suites 43/43; architecture inventory 7/7; system-Python runtime smoke 14/14; typecheck; deploy SQL, architecture, task, strict workflow, project-state and init dry-run gates
- Residual risks: repeated Git object/evidence hashing is the first 10x cost; Human authentication remains transport-owned; full-suite Host Homebrew `python3` startup can exceed its 15-second test timeout, while the exact file passes with `/usr/bin/python3`
- Reviewer action required: none
- Rollback: revert the single ME-2C publication; immutable evidence has no Task/Lease/Publication/Acceptance pointer and no daemon remains

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: approved contract-worktree implementation with Codex acceptance
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: the plan maps Contract, delegated-run and Binding authorities; traces exact Contract revision through proposal/round/assertion to trusted context and Human decision state; and keeps ME-2C as the smallest checkpoint projection rather than a Provider runtime
- Root cause or plan evidence: ME-2A deliberately emits untrusted WorkerResult bytes, so trusted reuse requires one exact candidate/verifier chain and byte-valid evidence without adding an authority transition

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: equivalent primary-agent exact-subject review plus strict repository gates passed
- Commands run: contract-focused suites, `bun run check:type`, `bun test --timeout 60000`, architecture inventory tests, required architecture/task/state/init checks, CodeGraph rebuild and ArchContext plan/apply
- Manual checks: traced exact Contract blob projection, unique continuous chain selection, unreachable-input rejection, result/runtime receipt revalidation, open-decision refusal, Human-only answer, stale Binding rejection, event/current recovery and absence of Task/Lease/Publication/Acceptance mutation imports
- Supporting artifacts: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`, architecture projection manifest, ME-2C tests, implementation notes, workstream and organization research
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes
- Run snapshot: full run reached 3,133 pass / 2 platform skips; its sole failure was the Host Homebrew `python3` startup timeout, and the exact runtime-smoke file passed 14/14 with `/usr/bin/python3`

- Summary: PASS: exact Contract projection, unique candidate-bound assertion chain, immutable evidence validation, and Human-fenced DecisionRequest recovery preserve all ME-2C authority boundaries.
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- The task Contract now carries one strict JSON semantic-constraint catalog whose exact commit/blob/bytes are content addressed.
- A verified context accepts only a complete root-to-leaf assertion chain with exact proposal, delegated-run, candidate, check and verifier subjects; Worker claims remain separately untrusted.
- DecisionRequest publication uses immutable event bytes plus expected-current CAS and repairs every supported crash boundary without timestamp or latest-file inference.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Human principal authentication remains outside the local CLI and must be supplied by a future transport adapter.
- Repeated Git blob and evidence hashing will be the first pressure point at larger checkpoint volumes; any cache must remain a digest-validated projection.
- ME-2C intentionally has no Provider dispatch, per-turn loop, writable grant or authority-transition route.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 10/10 | Exact projection, chain, evidence and decision recovery scenarios pass. |
| Product depth | 9/10 | Complete narrowed checkpoint P0; transport authentication stays correctly separate. |
| Design quality | 10/10 | One Contract authority and one unique evidence chain avoid dual truth. |
| Code quality | 10/10 | Closed schemas, canonical bytes, fail-closed joins and crash fixtures. |

## Failing Items

- None in product or contract scope. The full-suite Homebrew Python timeout is environment-specific and the exact test passes under the system interpreter.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun test tests/unit/me2c-verified-evidence-context.test.ts tests/cli/verified-context.test.ts tests/contract-run.test.ts --timeout 60000`
- Re-check: `repo-harness run verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, typed protocol-2 receipt, then `repo-harness run verify-sprint`

## Summary

- ME-2C is accepted and published as the verified checkpoint evidence projection.
