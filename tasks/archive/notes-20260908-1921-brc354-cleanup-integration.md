# Cleanup integration decisions

Keep #361 preparation authority and deterministic journals intact. The superseded #362 preparing marker is intentionally excluded. Cleanup is the sole production delta. Docker SIGKILL cases now reconcile and clean the reconstructed handle, then consume identical proof after deletion; missing request-only objects remain refused.

Baseline: PR #361 491ff094. Prior #362 f1c14080 cleanup review and tests informed the port but are not current integrated acceptance. PR #361 passed all five CI checks and independent preparation/cleanup security review, then merged as ba09b548. Its merged tree equals 491ff094; only this cleanup delta proceeds to new acceptance.

Initial integration run vx-9f7ed717614f4b8f9140: 21 passed, four Docker deadline failures. New cleanup tests no longer assume version execution leaves time before expiry; refusal is checked first, and preparation deadlines allow 10 seconds. Existing watchdog failures are retained for serial re-verification without concurrent projection work. Architecture bootstrap generated a projection file during verification, invalidating snapshot equality; subsequent apply is a stable noop. No production deadline or validation relaxed.

> **Substantive Change SHA256**: `sha256:f4f82c666e8b3912df3f0de30e12ba79bc687635e74d2bb9ee523ce85e7de52e`

Independent security delta review found no actionable issue in #361 request/name reconstruction composed with cleanup. Architecture review retained #361's whole preparation authority; no conflicting marker was ported.

Remote publication diff (merge-base:origin/main..HEAD, after workflow archival):

> **Substantive Change SHA256**: `sha256:e1b61573cf62bcb56d2094d7329823c45fc46f925a61671aa8eeb5c687a5a847`

This binds the remote diff projection; it does not replace the original runtime execution identity or expand acceptance to new source.

## Integration with parallel main update

Main advanced from ba09b548 to c17b004a with the separately accepted worktree-cleanup-closeout slice. The only merge conflict was generated docs/architecture/.projection-manifest.json; it was regenerated against the combined source and current CodeGraph. All four cleanup production/test paths are byte-identical to accepted f2a36aea, and the preparation/runtime/recovery/core sources are unchanged by that main update. The original Docker execution and AcceptanceReceipt retain their original subject and target. Current combined evidence is the required integrity/type/helper delta checks and new PR CI; no old receipt is relabeled as covering c17b004a.

Final remote diff against c17b004a, following conflict resolution:

> **Substantive Change SHA256**: `sha256:9904fa74e48c54924f945d8521694fad686fe90656fb6bcb09c9a500f305140b`

TypeScript, helper parity, six integrity checks and exact cleanup source/test equality passed on the combined candidate. Final PR CI remains its own required evidence.

## Single directly blocking out-of-scope correction

CI 34221837558 failed before tests: c17b004a changed the generated agentic-development-flow document without updating assets/reference-configs/agentic-development-flow.md. The exact accepted paragraph was added to that canonical template, then the standard projection/check was run. No wording or runtime behavior changed. This is the task's one directly blocking out-of-scope fix; another independent fault requires stopping.

Remote diff including the source-template correction:
