## Why

Campaign children block the controller event loop and currently have no generation-fenced renewal or consumable process-group evidence.

## Goal

Renew the current campaign Lease while its supervised child executes; cancel on lost authority and persist truthful scoped quiescence without asserting provider inactivity.

## Scope

- In scope: explicit policy admission, asynchronous bounded child, fenced renewal, supervisor evidence and regressions.
- Out of scope: automatic reclaim, provider mediation, BRC10 row completion and BRC13–15.
- Taste constraints: <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

A long-running acquired child has no renewal progression, stale ownership renews, a failed renewal launches the verifier, or process-group evidence falsely claims remote-provider completion.

## Root Cause Evidence

This code-change package includes one directly blocking policy transport correction. Its four-field pre-fix evidence and regression guard are recorded in the owning notes; the focused package test is part of the canonical Verification Plan.

## Workflow Inventory

- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`

- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Exit Criteria (Machine Verifiable)

This block contains only non-executable artifact requirements. Define every
executable check once in the canonical Verification Plan below. Each check must
state its phase, cost, evidence policy, necessity, and input environment; a
missing or malformed plan fails closed.

```yaml
exit_criteria:
  files_exist:
    - docs/spec.md
  artifacts_exist:
    - .ai/harness/checks/latest.json
    - tasks/archive/notes-20260907-0645-brc10-supervised-renewal.md

This is the sole executable verification authority. Use `baseline_with_delta`
only when a referenced immutable baseline plus named current delta checks prove
the intended coverage; do not infer that choice from paths or command text.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: current-owner renewal during a real child; cancellation and unresolved reservation on authority loss.
- Edge cases: historical missing policy, stale owner, reordered policy JSON, descendants and a killed supervisor with reused output directory.
- Regression risks: preserve existing campaign budget/retry settlement and generic contract-run behavior; no remote-provider terminal claim.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: main 188ae352.
- Revert strategy: stop new campaign dispatch and revert source; preserve all grants, journals and existing worktrees.
