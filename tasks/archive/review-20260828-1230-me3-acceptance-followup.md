## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: the six implementation and test files of commit `760c2ae3` / merge `a61f5b9b` — `src/cli/mcp/engineer-tools.ts`, `src/effects/engineers/provider-thread-effect-store.ts`, `src/effects/engineers/delegated-run-store.ts`, `tests/cli/mcp-engineer-tools.test.ts`, `tests/unit/me2a-me3b-readonly-delegation.test.ts`, `tasks/todos.md`
- Actual files changed: same six files; no additional paths landed in the slice
- Commands passed: focused six-file `bun test … --timeout 60000` 37 pass / 0 fail; `bun run check:type` exit 0; blast-radius re-run of `tests/unit/me1b-engineering-overlay.test.ts` 8 pass; `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance` 12/12 Fulfilled
- Residual risks: two P3 items carried forward — (1) `tests/unit/me2a-me3b-readonly-delegation.test.ts` rebuilds the substitution map with production's own keys, so a rename of `{execution_packet}` stays isomorphic and both sides would remain unsubstituted while still passing; (2) `plans/plan-20260828-1100-me3-acceptance-followup.md` states the rollback point as `cbda7ab4` while the actual fork point is `8afee4cf`
- Reviewer action required: none; two gate review rounds completed — round 1 returned FAIL with three findings, round 2 confirmed all three closed
- Rollback: revert merge `a61f5b9b` back to fork point `8afee4cf`
- Findings closure (round 2, item by item):
  - (a) `observeProviderThreadEffectStatus` is a pure read path with no `withEffectLock`, no `prepareStore`, and no `replaceCanonical`; skew fails closed as `provider_thread_effect_unreadable`, and the ownership check runs before `audit()` (`src/cli/mcp/engineer-tools.ts:501-506`).
  - (b) The dispatch argv is produced by placeholder substitution over `CODEX_READ_ONLY_ARGV_TEMPLATE` (`src/effects/engineers/delegated-run-store.ts:865-870`); the template is the only literal of that shape left in the repository.
  - (c) `tasks/todos.md:44`'s revisit trigger now points at the engineering-overlay two-pass read semantics (`src/core/engineers/engineering-overlay.ts:325-336` intersection vs `src/effects/engineers/engineering-overlay.ts:231` after-only); both line references were checked against the current tree.
- Receipt subject note: 本 receipt 的機讀 subject（`sha256:94cebb1f…`，`reviewed_paths` 僅 `docs/architecture/.projection-manifest.json`）因 receipt 輪晚於 merge/push 執行而不涵蓋本 slice，實際驗收證據以本卡與上列 run snapshots 為準。

- Summary: MCP engineer_thread_effect_status now reads through the pure observation path (no lock, no store mkdir, no current.json repair) with the ownership check before audit; the dispatch argv is derived from CODEX_READ_ONLY_ARGV_TEMPLATE by placeholder substitution, leaving one literal; the todos row-44 revisit trigger names the live engineering-overlay two-pass surface. Six-file focused suite 37 pass / 0 fail plus check:type clean. Machine-readable subject does not cover the slice because the receipt round ran after merge and push; the review card carries the human-authoritative acceptance evidence.
- Findings: P3: tests/unit/me2a-me3b-readonly-delegation.test.ts:249 rebuilds the substitution map with the same keys as production, so a placeholder rename of {execution_packet} would leave both sides unsubstituted and still pass; the pre-existing slice(0,11) literal at :239 covers only argv[0..10].; P3: plans/plan-20260828-1100-me3-acceptance-followup.md rollback text names main cbda7ab4 while the actual fork point is 8afee4cf (cbda7ab4 is an ancestor).
