## Why

A Codex version probe does not establish task readiness. The image must supply the actual harness package and target-native dependencies before paid execution.

## Goal

Build an immutable local campaign image containing the selected packed harness and provide an explicit no-auth operator preflight through existing containment, proving the target Linux verification tools work.

## Scope

- In scope: image supply, local build script, no-auth operator preflight, focused regression and real Linux dependency probe.
- Out of scope: campaign recovery, budget changes, grant minting, watchdog/mount permission changes, package publication and unrelated Docker infrastructure.
- Taste constraints: <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

The supplied image cannot run the real repo-harness verify-sprint helper in existing containment, or Linux-native package loading still fails after lockfile-bound preparation. Original-image regression is the cheapest proof.

## Root Cause Evidence

Original frozen image failed the actual helper regression with exit 127.

- root_cause: deploy/campaign-container/Dockerfile installs Codex but not harness, while campaign-runtime only probes Codex and mounts host-prepared native dependencies into Linux.
- repro: BRC_TEST_CONTAINER_IMAGE=sha256:72270cb098680b4e5e9e34f3ed7da6d861551bf946813a485069554055e08523 bun test tests/effects/campaign-environment.test.ts

- Source plan: `plans/archive/plan-20260909-2347-campaign-execution-environment.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260910-0002-campaign-execution-environment.md`

- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Change Assessment

```json
{"protocol":1,"oracles":[{"id":"campaign-image-runtime-readback","kind":"runtime_readback","paths":["*"]}]}
```

## Acceptance Policy

```json

```

## Allowed Paths

```yaml
allowed_paths:
  - deploy/campaign-container/Dockerfile
  - scripts/build-campaign-image.sh
  - scripts/run-campaign-preflight.ts
  - tests/effects/campaign-environment.test.ts

```

## Evidence Requirements

```yaml
evidence_requirements:
  # Set benchmark to required when this contract consumes the harness profile benchmark matrix.
  benchmark: not_applicable
```

## Delegation Contract

```yaml
delegation:
  budget:
    tokens: null
    runner_invocations: null
    wall_time_minutes: null

## Exit Criteria (Machine Verifiable)

This block contains only non-executable artifact requirements. Define every
executable check once in the canonical Verification Plan below. Each check must
state its phase, cost, evidence policy, necessity, and input environment; a
missing or malformed plan fails closed.

```yaml
exit_criteria:
  files_exist:
    - docs/researches/20260909-campaign-execution-environment.md
  artifacts_exist:
    - .ai/harness/checks/latest.json
    - tasks/archive/notes-20260910-0002-campaign-execution-environment.md
```

This is the sole executable verification authority. Use `baseline_with_delta`
only when a referenced immutable baseline plus named current delta checks prove
the intended coverage; do not infer that choice from paths or command text.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: exact packed harness CLI and Linux target tools, no credentials or campaign mutations.
- Edge cases: command failure, absent command, bounded deadline and readonly preflight preserve failure results.
- Regression risks: image artifact content and trusted helper resolution; verify through the actual container, not source assertions.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: origin/main 721d8f31.
- Revert strategy: revert this isolated PR and retain all recorded failure/stop evidence.
