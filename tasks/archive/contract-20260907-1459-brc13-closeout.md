## Why

BRC13 must close only the adopted Issue whose complete Task set has integrated, then clean its exact execution topology without racing a new owner or repeating an unknown external mutation.

## Goal

Deliver the ordered campaign closeout transaction, bounded mutation/readback evidence, actual merge revision proof, exact remote and local cleanup, and cleanup_pending admission fence.

## Scope

- In scope: BRC13 Provider/merge/cleanup authority, existing budget and publication consumers, shared bind/cleanup lock, CLI entry, focused regressions and delivery.
- Out of scope: Operator/Fleet board projection, notification runtime store, BRC6a readback semantics, real campaign runs and global release.
- Taste constraints: <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

A cleanup concurrent with a new bind, a close before all Issue Tasks have actual reachable merge evidence, or a repeated unknown mutation falsifies this design. Prove each with disposable process/Git/Provider fixtures.

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/archive/plan-20260907-1224-brc13-closeout.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260907-1459-brc13-closeout.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/archive/notes-20260907-1459-brc13-closeout.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Exit Criteria (Machine Verifiable)

This block contains only non-executable artifact requirements. Define every
executable check once in the canonical Verification Plan below. Each check must
state its phase, cost, evidence policy, necessity, and input environment; a
missing or malformed plan fails closed.

```yaml
exit_criteria:
  files_exist:
    - docs/researches/20260907-brc13-closeout.md
    - src/effects/automation/campaign-closeout.ts
    - src/effects/automation/campaign-not-planned.ts

This is the sole executable verification authority. Use `baseline_with_delta`
only when a referenced immutable baseline plus named current delta checks prove
the intended coverage; do not infer that choice from paths or command text.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: original prepare 18/18 at be1de662; reviewed P1 corrections are included at f009e9b6.
- Edge cases: correction consumer baseline vx-c4dd146b5b6e4f1c8130 passed on f009e9b6 plus deterministic architecture projection. Subsequent delta changes only one test expected error string and workflow evidence; product source is unchanged. Current closeout-effects and typecheck cover that delta. This is baseline plus delta, not a new full-suite claim.
- Regression risks: unknown POST without matching bounded readback remains reconciliation pending; writable inactivity must still be proven.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint:
- Revert strategy:

Final publication delta: archive prediction helper now copies the exact configured review target into its private scratch clone. This is the single directly blocking scope extension. Campaign source is unchanged from accepted d439df53; retained transaction evidence vx-c52d56a1a8ff47fcb5e5 and consumer evidence vx-c4dd146b5b6e4f1c8130 are baseline only, combined with current archive-effects, typecheck and all integrity checks.
