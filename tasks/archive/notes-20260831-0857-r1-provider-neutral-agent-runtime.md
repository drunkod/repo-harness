## Design Decisions

- Task Inbox has no delivery receipt before the first delivery attempt. That absence is the canonical `pending` state; the Agent Runtime effect freezes delivery attempt `1` and never synthesizes a receipt.
- Task IDs and task revisions use the repository's existing raw 64-hex authority shape. The plan's `sha256` shorthand describes content identity, not a wire-format prefix.
- `EngineerBindingV1.provider_thread_id` remains the historical opaque endpoint locator. Under `tmux-cli-agent` it is only a Host resolver token and is never accepted as a caller-selected raw tmux target.
- Positive completion is owned exclusively by an exact persisted Task/Module delivery receipt. Process exit, pane content, adapter stdout/stderr and elapsed time cannot produce `observed_success`.
- A V1 migration crash after archive rename recovers only when exactly one digest-named archive exists and its tree digest proves the expected source. Missing or ambiguous archives fail closed.
- The final fixed-point architecture apply, after archiving the handled adapter-path request, produced receipt `sha256:6d1d03493a689cbc3eac9182d182252536b2d4e0f586538e53d28db7ce40590b` with no human actions.

## Deviations From Plan Or Spec

- The real tmux canary ran against a temporary already-bound local session and passed. The real Codex App Thread canary also ran and passed on 2026-08-31 (see Deviations); the earlier unavailability note is superseded.

## Tradeoffs Considered

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Invoke adapters inside `engineer runtime-effect start` | Reject | The command owns persist-first admission and returns one closed Host action; automatic execution would merge endpoint resolver authority into the journal boundary. |
| Retry after an unknown tmux/Codex outcome | Reject | At-most-once action admission is the safety invariant; ambiguity becomes `reconciliation_required`. |
| Parse tmux pane output as acknowledgement | Reject | Pane text is untrusted runtime output and cannot compete with Inbox receipt authority. |

## Open Questions

- (none; the real Codex App Thread canary closed the last review blocker on 2026-08-31)
- Receipt correlation settled at delivery time: a Task receipt reserves `agent_runtime_effect` while pending, and `transitionTaskMessageDeliveryReceipt` settles channel+`delivery_ref` together at delivered — a human-facing lane that delivers a receipt reserved for an effect records its own channel instead of fabricating an effect reference. Module success requires the observation chain to carry the exact control ref at the effect's delivery attempt; plain hook observations (null ref) reconcile instead of succeeding.

## Evidence Links

- Checks: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`

## Promotion Filter

Promote a candidate to `tasks/lessons.md`, `docs/researches/`, or harness asset files only when all three hold: hard to reverse, surprising without local context, and a real trade-off existed. If any one is missing, keep it in this notes file instead.

## Promotion Candidates

- Promote to `tasks/lessons.md` only after a repeated correction or failure pattern.
- Promote to `docs/researches/` only when it is durable repo knowledge with evidence.
- Promote to harness asset files only after verification across more than one task or fixture.
