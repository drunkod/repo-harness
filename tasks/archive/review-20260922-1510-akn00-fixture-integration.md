## Integration scope

Merge of exact owner-accepted PR #436 fixture branch into existing stage source. The only conflict was generated architecture proof, regenerated through the configured provider. Current stage production source must compare byte-for-byte with `e0c032d18fcf826d1fe08334f4fab5f91060a4ba`. Canonical verification and acceptance of the integrated head remain pending; H0 stays unproven.

## PR base verification binding

The original integration digest above binds its narrow follow-up base. Hosted CI verifies the full PR against `0d4371c3f95e63851f4e083718f3337bf9646345`; the independent review already covered that pinned base and the same unchanged substantive sources. This additional range binding records that exact full-PR diff without changing accepted contract or goal authority.
