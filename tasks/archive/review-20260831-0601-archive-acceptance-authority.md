## Human Review Card

- Verdict: accepted by the named owner after the frozen external review budget was exhausted
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: archive writer, acceptance authority, merge gate, packaged copies, workflow artifacts, and focused tests
- Actual files changed: matched the contract allowlist
- Commands passed: all 19 contract criteria, including the 3554-test full suite
- Residual risks: historical protocol-1 archives remain readable but are not retroactively sealed until explicitly migrated
- Reviewer action required: none
- Rollback: revert the three implementation commits before merging

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: Codex plugin cross-review, then typed owner waiver under the frozen contract policy
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: plan and implementation notes
- Root cause or plan evidence: host archive projection was not authenticated and collision suffixes broke filename-derived evidence binding

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: `repo-harness run verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`
- Commands run: all contract `tests_pass` and `commands_succeed`
- Manual checks: source/template byte parity and archive receipt chaining
- Supporting artifacts: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes
- Run snapshot: `.ai/harness/runs/run-20260831T051510-52449-20260831-0345-archive-acceptance-authority.json`

- Summary: Owner approved the completed bounded archive acceptance authority work-package after all required checks passed.
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Archive pointer rewrites are now explicit and collision-safe, while a
  host-owned receipt prevents a self-consistent repository rewrite from
  redirecting accepted authority.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Historical unprojected archives keep their existing strict read path; no
  automatic migration or semantic acceptance was added.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 10/10 | Exact archive, renewal, tamper, and closeout paths are covered. |
| Product depth | 9/10 | Scope stays at the required workflow authority boundary. |
| Design quality | 9/10 | One repository writer plus one host-owned seal; no fallback authority. |
| Code quality | 9/10 | Source/template parity and full-suite conformance are verified. |

## Failing Items

- None.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `repo-harness run verify-sprint --contract tasks/contracts/20260831-0345-archive-acceptance-authority.contract.md`
- Re-check: AcceptanceReceipt plus ArchiveProjectionReceipt identity after archival.

## Summary

- Accepted under the frozen owner-waiver policy after all blocking external
  review findings were fixed and the complete required check set passed.
