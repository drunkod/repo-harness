## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass for implementation diff; AcceptanceReceipt remains unavailable.
- Change type: bugfix
- Intended files changed: verifier source/projection, focused tests, and workflow evidence.
- Actual files changed: `scripts/verify-contract.sh`, `assets/templates/helpers/verify-contract.sh`, `tests/unit/package-owned-test-runner.test.ts`, `tests/helper-scripts.test.ts`, plan/contract/notes/review/todo.
- Commands passed: focused guard 6/6; helper suite 129/129; helper sync; typecheck; source strict read-only contract 25/25; BYOK external paths 4/4; env-scrubbed trace-observer 9/9.
- Residual risks: full suite exits 1 only because two unrelated trace-observer tests inherit ambient Codex identity; branch synchronization and typed AcceptanceReceipt remain separate closeout gates.
- Reviewer action required: no code finding; complete policy-bound AcceptanceReceipt after branch synchronization if merging.
- Rollback: revert the package-test-runner commit and both helper copies together.

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: bugfix / verification boundary
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: plan captures verifier, package manifest, deployed helper, bounded runner, and consumer path authority.
- Root cause or plan evidence: pre-fix artifact proves bare `bun test <path>` bypassed package-local configuration.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: not invoked; gatekeeper performed the authorized read-only acceptance review.
- Commands run: see Human Review Card and implementation notes.
- Manual checks: no bare-Bun fallback; source/template byte parity; exact resolved command included in report; read-only BYOK status unchanged.
- Supporting artifacts: pre-fix log, source contract report, BYOK report.
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes.
- Run snapshot: `.ai/harness/runs/20260821-2226-package-owned-test-runner-contract-source.json`.

## Acceptance Receipt Projection

- Summary: No AcceptanceReceipt has been recorded.
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- `tests_pass` changes from verifier-owned bare Bun execution to the nearest canonical package's declared `scripts.test` authority.
- Missing/malformed owner manifests, missing scripts, and repository/symlink escapes fail closed without a retry path.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- The branch is not merged and no installed runtime has been refreshed from it yet.
- The ambient Codex test-isolation defect is outside this contract and remains report-only.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 10/10 | BYOK and disposable consumer paths pass through the declared package runner. |
| Product depth | 9/10 | Covers root/workspace, malformed/missing authority, and symlink escape. |
| Design quality | 9/10 | One runner authority and fail-closed resolution; no schema or fallback path. |
| Code quality | 9/10 | Source/projection parity and focused regression coverage are green. |

## Failing Items

- No finding in the implementation diff.
- Closeout-only: no typed AcceptanceReceipt; full suite carries two confirmed ambient-environment failures outside this diff.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun test tests/unit/package-owned-test-runner.test.ts` and direct source `verify-contract.sh --strict --read-only`.
- Re-check: `/tmp/byok-package-owned-tests.report.json`, helper parity, and exact branch ancestry before merge.

## Summary

- Gatekeeper verdict PASS. The bugfix is locally commit-ready; merge/acceptance/runtime refresh remain separately gated.
