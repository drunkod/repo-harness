## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: ME-4C closed schemas/effects/CLI/tests, Approved PRD, ArchContext projection and workflow evidence
- Actual files changed: immutable IntegrationContract/Envelope/Matrix/ProductProjection store; strict current Publication/Git/requirement/Acceptance joins; bounded integration CLI; two-publication, race, symlink and route fixtures; architecture/workstream artifacts
- Commands passed: focused ME-4C and Publication/Acceptance regressions; typecheck; full repository suite 3112 pass / 2 platform skips / 0 fail; architecture projection validation
- Residual risks: acceptance revalidates every selected publication and Git fence synchronously; at 10x publication count local Git/filesystem latency fails before schema or authority correctness
- Reviewer action required: none
- Rollback: revert the single ME-4C publication commit; immutable content-addressed evidence has no mutable pointer and existing Task/Lease/Publication/Acceptance authorities remain unchanged

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: parent-agent implementation and deterministic acceptance
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: captured plan and implementation notes; Git, Publication and Acceptance remain independent authorities joined by an exact-subject evidence projection
- Root cause or plan evidence: two-publication fixture mutates requirement, current Lease pointer/status, evidence, immutable-store ancestry and AcceptanceReceipt bytes; each mismatch fails before product projection

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: equivalent strict repository gate set passed; exact-subject Human waiver was projected
- Commands run: focused ME-4C suites, Publication/Acceptance regressions, `bun run check:type`, and `bun test --timeout 60000`
- Manual checks: reviewed exact-key/canonical validation, existing-commit ancestry, current Lease/Publication joins, AcceptanceReceipt byte revalidation, symlink fail-closed storage, and absence of merge/waiver/authority mutation routes; the frozen `origin/main` subject also carries the already-accepted ME-1B paths, covered by their deterministic oracle and the full green suite
- Supporting artifacts: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`, architecture projection manifest, focused ME-4C tests and full-suite output
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes
- Run snapshot: full suite 3112 pass / 2 skip / 0 fail across 254 files

- Summary: User approved the bounded ME-4C integration acceptance slice and continuous implementation through ME-2B.
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- An operator can freeze an Approved requirement and exact work-package revisions into one immutable IntegrationContract.
- The envelope accepts only the current reviewing Lease-owned PublicationReceipt for every work package and proves each publication plus base is contained in the exact current Git candidate.
- The matrix binds one exact evidence row per closed constraint plus the verifier receipt; product projection re-reads every fence and projects only an existing passing protocol-2 AcceptanceReceipt.
- No CLI route constructs merges, records waivers, changes Task/Lease/Publication/Acceptance state, starts a Provider, or introduces a daemon.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Repeated synchronous Git and filesystem reads are intentionally the smallest correct P0. If measured latency grows materially with publication count, bounded batch collection can preserve the same immutable schemas and fences.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 10/10 | Exact candidate, stale-fence and product projection paths pass. |
| Product depth | 9/10 | Complete P0 evidence plane; merge construction and Human release remain correctly outside scope. |
| Design quality | 10/10 | Reuses Git, Publication and Acceptance authorities without adding mutable pointers or a second verdict. |
| Code quality | 10/10 | Closed schemas, canonical digests, race/symlink guards, focused regression coverage and full verification. |

## Failing Items

- None.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun test --timeout 60000`
- Re-check: `repo-harness run verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, typed waiver receipt, then `repo-harness run verify-sprint`

## Summary

- ME-4C is accepted and canonically published inside the approved control-plane boundary.
