## Why

An exact supervised verifier rejection is known, but zero process exits make failure settlement skip the attempt and finish then reads an absent worker result.

## Goal

Settle one controller-owned permanent_failure/verifier_rejected from existing exact runtime evidence without creating a worker result; allow a fresh stopped-adopted continuation under all existing quiescence and authority guards.

## Scope

- In scope: campaign-worker.ts failure settlement and matching stopped-failed readback; focused model-free regression tests and workflow/research.
- Completed prerequisite: narrow runner output prompt repair on this branch, already accepted.
- Out of scope: grant expiry changes, refunds, resurrecting old dispatches, inferred worker outcome, verifier schema changes, other recovery or product repairs.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

A supervised typed verifier failure with two exact inactive zero-exit children and no worker result remains unaccounted; or pass/unknown/tampered evidence can produce the new final; or any stopped-resume ownership/publication guard is weakened.

## Root Cause Evidence

- root_cause: src/effects/automation/campaign-worker.ts skips child exit0 in settleObservedCampaignFailureUnderLock before finish reads the missing worker result.
- repro: bun test tests/effects/campaign-verifier-failure.test.ts
- regression_guard: tests/effects/campaign-verifier-failure.test.ts
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: tasks/evidence/campaign-verifier-failure-pre-fix.log

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/archive/plan-20260910-0321-campaign-verifier-failure.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260910-0333-campaign-verifier-failure.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/archive/notes-20260910-0333-campaign-verifier-failure.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

A fresh explicitly authorized campaign may retry a known verifier rejection, including code-quality rejection; permanent_failure remains terminal for the old attempt. This does not auto-retry, grant a new acquire, or infer an external block. Current user approval permits one additional acquire with other remaining caps conserved. No provider runs in verification. Use named lifecycle/runner checks; no uncovered integration risk justifies a local full suite.

## Rollback Point

Revert this known-verifier-failure delta. Preserve immutable persisted finals, usage, stopped campaigns and runtime journals.
