## Development Evidence

HTTP/IPC/browser suites:153 pass,2 Windows-only skip,0 fail,789 assertions. Budget owner suite:57 pass,0 fail,364 assertions. Campaign owner suite:25 pass with one initial wrapper-versus-receipt test error; corrected owning case passes with9 assertions and verifies the real receipt in the summary. Automation source suite:5 pass,0 fail,33 assertions; it covers actual durable records, real collector HTTP, no locks or changed bytes, source isolation, count limits, exact environment, registry drift and missing versus unavailable. Logs are under `.ai/harness/runs/akn04-automation-summary/`.

Typecheck, browser build (4 modules,29.37KB), all9 required integrity checks and git diff --check passed. These are development checks, not canonical acceptance.

## Acceptance Boundary

No semantic review has run or AcceptanceReceipt been issued for this candidate. Local CodeGraph proof, canonical verification and stage PR remain pending this worktree's indexing decision. Native execution/turn authority remains explicitly unavailable. Main merge and runtime install have not occurred.

## Authorized index and deterministic projection

The owner approved this worktree local index on 2026-09-22. CodeGraph initialization succeeded at source `2d90d44b339b4b86d5b7c453036671a7dece6ba4`. Deterministic plan/apply updated only `docs/architecture/.projection-manifest.json`, with no human actions or refresh signals. Receipts are `.ai/harness/runs/approved-index-proof/{plan,apply}.json`. Canonical verification and semantic acceptance remain pending; this proof does not establish Host admission.

## Canonical verification after index approval

Canonical prepare-acceptance passed 21/21 criteria with zero failures, covering 17 execution checks at `92f785d2104d400b5350f3ec9d7f8364244537b2`. Subject: `sha256:376538d3231ea1e5659f88ce182c716c4c38be1d8d002b6939a2dff86499035f`. Evidence: `.ai/harness/runs/run-20260922T142330-9765-20260922-0534-akn04-automation-summary.json` and `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`. The current deterministic architecture check passed. This is local machine verification; semantic acceptance, hosted CI and installed/native journey claims remain separate.

## Current integrated verification and independent acceptance

At76f989cc, canonical run20260923T030703-30025 passed20 execution checks and24 total criteria. Subject: `sha256:51cded6ae80f7e99bca5a548302915bae6fa1c3e233f030a363bc959138c13a2`; policy baseorigin/main0d4371c3. Current CodeGraph projection is a deterministic manifest-only refresh. The single Codex plugin review matched this exact frozen subject and returned approve with no findings. Its private checkout could not rerun browser tests because React was absent; the canonical local UI decoder/build, effects and HTTP suites passed independently. Full hosted CI for this new source is pending.

Verbatim provider transcript:

```json
{"verdict":"approve","summary":"No material blocker found in the scoped diff against the pinned base. Checkout is clean. 101 unit tests passed; browser tests were blocked by missing React, and effect/HTTP suites were not rerun.","findings":[],"next_steps":[]}
```

Original structured result: `.ai/harness/runs/akn04-automation-summary/cross-review.json`.

- Summary: The single official Codex plugin review approved exact subject51cded6ae80f7e99bca5a548302915bae6fa1c3e233f030a363bc959138c13a2 against pinned origin/main0d4371c3 with no findings. Canonical20 checks and24 criteria passed locally. Reviewer browser rerun was unavailable due to missing React; canonical local effect/HTTP/browser evidence remains authoritative. Full hosted CI is pending separately.
- Findings: none
