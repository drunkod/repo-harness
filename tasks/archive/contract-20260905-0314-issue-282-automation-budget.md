## Why

An unattended automation controller currently has stall protection but no machine-enforced cost ceiling: a goal that keeps making slow material progress can spend acquisitions, runner invocations, wall time and provider quota indefinitely. Prompt text such as "stop after N tokens" is not an enforcement mechanism, and summing totals after a provider call cannot prevent the next claim or dispatch. If this ships wrong, an unattended run either burns unbounded quota, or worse, silently under-counts a crashed operation and keeps spending against a ledger it knows is incomplete.

## Goal

Deliver one typed budget authority plus an append-only consumption ledger per automation run, with reserve-before-act enforcement under a per-budget lock, a frozen absolute wall-clock deadline, provider-verified-usage-only token/cost limits, idempotent single charging, typed reconciliation after a crash between reservation and usage append, strictest composition with contract-level runner budgets, and an immutable `AutomationStopReceiptV1` published on exhaustion, projected into a read-only operator surface.

## Scope

- In scope: `src/core/automation/` pure limits, composition, reservation evaluation, ledger fold, digests and board-slice projection; `src/effects/automation/` ledger store under `<git-common-dir>/repo-harness/automation-budget/v1/` with per-run lock, CAS current record, immutable reservations/usage events/reconciliations/stop receipt; `src/cli/commands/automation.ts` read-only budget projection; the PRD `ProgramBudgetLimitV1` / `ProgramBudgetEventV1` field extension that this implementation makes real; capability node, module doc, spec and deferred-goal ledger closure.
- Out of scope: the unattended controller loop itself (issue #279); provider usage extraction changes beyond reading already-verified usage evidence; task identity (`coordination-identity.ts`, #283), lease liveness (#286), attempt receipts (#287), acquire-next (#280) — those bind through typed nullable slots only; budget auto-renewal or auto-increase; an operator HTTP route or web UI surface.
- Taste constraints: fail closed with typed refusals; never synthesize a usage number the provider did not attest; no second authorization shape beside `ProgramAuthorizationV1`.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

If two concurrent processes can each obtain a reservation that together exceed the same hard limit, or if a run that crashed between reservation and usage append can reserve again without an explicit evidence-bearing reconciliation, the reserve-before-act design is wrong and a post-hoc accounting design would be no worse. Cheapest proof point: the spawned two-worker contention test against a budget whose remaining acquisition headroom is exactly one.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).
