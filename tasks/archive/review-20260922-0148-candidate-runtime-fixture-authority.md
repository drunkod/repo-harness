## Scope and root cause

Test-only fixture repair: copyRuntimeFixture must modify the source-owned MANAGED_STOP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS in its disposable old runtime. The retained candidate stays at 150. Pre-fix existing tests: 6 pass, 2 fail, PRE_FIX_EXIT=1; both failures at the obsolete literal assertion before reconciliation. No new case/file or production change.

## Verification

All 11 canonical executable checks passed. Independent codex-plugin review approved semantic subject sha256:9213b38459930b40a3c4889a197039603d85b9db0e723d2a6850040ac2bcb755 against main 0d4371c3 with no findings. AcceptanceReceipt recording is the next closeout action. The existing test file is the regression guard. The branch-aware task-sync digest above binds the PR diff, including after archive. No true HOME or installed runtime is changed.

- Summary: No material blockers found in the exact three-file scope across all four change sources against the pinned base. The fixture targets the current timeout authority and preserves reconciliation assertions. Review was read-only; tests were not rerun.
- Findings: none

## Residual boundaries

Hosted CI is separate. This patch must be incorporated into the stage branches before their known baseline failure can be considered fixed; no merge is performed here.
