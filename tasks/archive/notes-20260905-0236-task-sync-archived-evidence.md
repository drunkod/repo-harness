## Design Decisions

- Treat only archive artifacts added during the effective-base-to-final-tree publication as evidence. A pre-existing archive remains historical and cannot be edited to satisfy a new substantive digest.
- Limit archive evidence to the same canonical lifecycle families accepted before closeout: plan, contract, review, and notes. Todo archives remain non-evidence.
- Reuse Git's add classification with rename detection disabled, so destination-path admission is independent of user Git config, and retain the existing exact digest line; do not introduce a second parser for archive envelopes.

## Deviations From Plan Or Spec

- None recorded.

## Tradeoffs Considered

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Accept every changed archive | Reject | It would let a historical archive be edited to launder an unrelated digest. |
| Parse `Archive Projection V1` again | Reject | Archive structure already has an owner; task-sync only needs range membership plus the existing exact digest binding. |
| Accept newly added canonical archive artifacts | Use | It models the single-publication closeout while preserving fail-closed behavior for historical files. |

## Open Questions

- None.

## Evidence Links

- Checks: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Pre-fix regression: `.ai/harness/runs/task-sync-archived-evidence/pre-fix.log` (`PRE_FIX_EXIT=1`)
- Focused suite: `bun test tests/check-task-sync.test.ts --timeout 60000` — 25 pass, 0 fail.
- Full suite: `bun test --timeout 60000` — 4148 pass, 4 skip, 0 fail, 53959 assertions.

## Promotion Filter

Promote a candidate to `tasks/lessons.md`, `docs/researches/`, or harness asset files only when all three hold: hard to reverse, surprising without local context, and a real trade-off existed. If any one is missing, keep it in this notes file instead.

## Promotion Candidates

- None. The invariant is enforced directly by the helper and regression tests.
