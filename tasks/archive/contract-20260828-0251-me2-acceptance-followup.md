## Why

ME-2A acceptance found three MEDIUM gaps: admission evidence is extrapolated from a different Codex subcommand than dispatch actually runs, child processes inherit the full parent environment with no receipt binding (a hard prerequisite gap for any future writable delegation), and the PRD-promised typed rejection is a dead enum that leaks host-absolute paths. ME-2C acceptance surfaced two low-cost validation gaps (duplicate catalog silently takes the first, check/verifier receipts may be the same artifact).

## Goal

Bind the delegated-run environment into the evidence chain, cover or explicitly record the dispatch-surface proof gap, deliver typed rejections with path hygiene and dead-enum cleanup, and land the two verified-context hardening checks — each with regression tests.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - `src/effects/engineers/delegated-run-store.ts`: `inheritEnv: false` + minimal env allowlist for canary and dispatch; env-set digest recorded in process and capability receipts; dispatch-surface denial probe (or explicit Known Unknowns + receipt record if infeasible); `trackedRegularFile` ENOENT -> `delegated_run_profile_unavailable`; admission `role_profile_unavailable`; repo-relative error paths; dead-enum cleanup.
  - `src/core/engineers/delegation.ts`: rejection enum adjustments to match real producers.
  - `src/effects/engineers/verified-context-store.ts`: exactly-one catalog assertion.
  - `src/core/engineers/verified-context.ts`: check/verifier receipt distinctness.
  - Regression tests in `tests/unit/me2a-me3b-readonly-delegation.test.ts`, `tests/cli/delegation.test.ts`, `tests/unit/me2c-verified-evidence-context.test.ts`.
  - `plans/prds/20260825-1551-delegated-run-adapter.prd.md` Known Unknowns entry only if the probe route is infeasible.
- Out of scope:
  - any writable delegation surface, ME-2B canary changes, `role_unavailable` naming beyond what the delegation schema already declares, PRD rewrites beyond the Known Unknowns entry if the probe route is infeasible.
- Taste constraints: <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

What observable evidence would prove this task's direction wrong, and the cheapest proof point to check first. Leave as-is if not applicable.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260828-0142-me2-acceptance-followup.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260828-0142-me2-acceptance-followup.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/20260828-0142-me2-acceptance-followup.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.
