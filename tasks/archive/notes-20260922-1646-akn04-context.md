## Decisions

- Board and TaskOffer remain the identity/readiness/proof owners. Exact selection occurs before per-card plan reads and retains original row index.
- The canonical sprint and registered-worktree source proof have different bases; the DTO labels the latter explicitly.
- Context and activity share private worker admission/exit handling because both need the same cancellation invariant. TaskDiff/collaboration and POST guards are outside this slice.
- Stable cross-store observation does not imply atomicity or current write permission. Durable semantics are in `docs/researches/20260922-operator-task-context.md`.

## Verification decisions

- Initial method test omitted Origin and therefore correctly received403 before method405; fixture now supplies the authorized origin to test the method guard. Host guard returns421 and was asserted accordingly. Production guards were preserved.
- A second-observation registry mutation regression failed before the final authority read and passed after it. This closes the actual observation window without changing authorization semantics.
- New effects suite owns the independent current context boundary; existing offer/server/activity/browser tests remain owning oracles. No full suite or providers.

## Open boundaries

- Scoped automation observation, UI/refresh and historical context are separate approved roadmap slices.
- The owner approved the existing local CodeGraph index; integrated-source canonical verification and the single semantic acceptance remain pending.

## Final source verification

Focused effects/offer/write-inventory/activity/browser tests:129 pass,0 fail,563 assertions (`.ai/harness/runs/akn04-context/focused-final.log`). Current context and historical activity route/lifecycle tests:7 pass,0 fail,30 assertions (`server-final.log`,28 unrelated server cases filtered). Final typecheck passes and browser transport bundles2 modules/5.72KB. These exact development checks do not replace the pending full contract Verification Plan or semantic acceptance. Substantive digest is `sha256:bebbd4a9cd42b3f409b9b11fd1378f28c97f7b00801f69cf2c4a4d181c97887e`.

## Accepted upstream integration

P1: accepted activity26778190 and its protected-reply/placement dependencies are upstream inputs; this slice owns current context and the private shared activity/context worker lifecycle. P2: each GET keeps its strict decoder and registry authority while sharing admission, cancellation and worker-exit release. P3: preserve context shared lifecycle and the incoming canonical reply limit; regenerate the conflicting projection through the provider. At10x concurrent reads, admission refuses busy before accumulating unbounded workers. Existing activity/context/server tests are the integration oracles; no new source authority or test file is introduced.
