## Purpose

Keep the P0 external evidence plane auditable and isolated from canonical planning and execution authorities.

## Frozen Boundary

- GitHub observations and receipts remain immutable provider-neutral evidence.
- The only P0 refresh is explicit, manual, bounded, and policy-gated.
- No external record binds or mutates a TaskOffer, Claim, Lease, WorkEnvelope, collaboration signal, or Agent Runtime effect.

## Progress

- [x] Architecture capability and immutable evidence component registered.
- [x] Protocol, strict policy, Git common-dir store, bounded GitHub adapter, projection and CLI implemented.
- [x] Focused and repository acceptance evidence complete for P0.
- [x] WP2 append-only source-to-canonical-task binding, drift projection, untrusted context, and CLI bridge implemented.
- [x] WP2 acceptance and PR merge complete; the accepted workflow family is archived and the implementation is on `main`.
