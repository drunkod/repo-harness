## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pending
- Change type: code-change | docs-only | ledger-closeout | migration | eval-only | delegated-run | frontend
- Intended files changed:
- Actual files changed:
- Check IDs and evidence disposition:
- Residual risks:
- Reviewer action required: inspect diff and card
- Rollback:

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route:
- P1/P2/P3 evidence:
- Root cause or plan evidence:

## Verification Evidence

Follow [Testing Policy and Artifact Standards](../../docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md#testing-policy-and-artifact-standards).
Consume canonical evidence; do not rerun checks to populate this review or
copy the executable plan. Return missing/stale evidence to its execution owner.

- Waza `/check` review reference, when required:
- Check IDs and disposition (executed / exact reuse / baseline with delta / failed / missing / not run):
- Verified subject, relevant environment and immutable execution references:
- Historical baseline and current delta references, if applicable:
- Manual observations, failures and coverage limitations:
- Implementation notes reviewed, if present:
- Run snapshot:

## Manual Check Evidence

Copy each non-built-in contract `manual_checks` requirement exactly. Check it only after
the observation is complete and replace the placeholder with concrete command output,
screenshot/artifact path, or reviewer observation.

- [ ] Exact manual_checks requirement
  - Evidence: concrete observation, command output, screenshot path, or reviewer note

## Staged owner acceptance (not final AcceptanceReceipt)

- [REQ-2] H0 PASS: designated advisor-gatekeeper checked f1dcd5b6 and independently reran deterministic lifecycle proof.
- [REQ-3] H1 withheld pending B1–B4; corrections committed separately at c6b5a913.
- [REQ-3b] H1 PASS: reviewer independently inspected b4b48c00..c6b5a913, reran tests/herdr-task-lifecycle.test.ts + tests/cli/task-agent.test.ts (8 pass / 103 expect / 28.8s), check:type exit 0; default workspace/pane counts unchanged (w8=3), primary original two dirty files preserved, commit has no AI attribution.
- Final review and typed receipt remain pending until H2–H6. This checkpoint is not a final merge/ship recommendation.

- [REQ-4] H2 FAIL / bounded corrections: designated reviewer reproduced non-convergent vanished/closed/open-intent workspace states, role intent before registration, and missing Bash start coverage. No H2 PASS; 441acd15 is the correction baseline.

- [REQ-4b] H2 PASS: designated reviewer inspected 441acd15..dc8316bf; lifecycle+CLI 9 pass/152 expect, Claude review 21 pass/98 expect, contract-worktree 46 pass/990 expect, type exit 0; default unchanged, no residual processes, primary dirty files preserved, helpers identical. H3 authorized; final receipt still pending.


## GATE 第1轮 — FAIL / corrections pending

- Reviewer forwarded F1 HIGH: guide projection drift and generator missing hand-added uninstall block.
- F2 HIGH: residual old tool/goal/skill/plugin names across operator docs/README/global packet comments; rebase required.
- F3 MEDIUM: now-irrelevant host detection/policy substitution remains.
- No PASS or AcceptanceReceipt issued. Correct in three separate commits, canonical then CHECKPOINT-4. Paused paths and existing Claude domain stay intact.


## GATE 第2轮 — stage PASS / publication authorized

- User relayed gatekeeper PASS for current A–D/H3 cumulative PR stage after F1–F3. Safe_auto is the sole remaining change before push/PR; no extra semantic reviewer invoked.
- This stage PASS does not mint final full-cutover AcceptanceReceipt or certify real model/sandbox behavior. Paused/H4/H5/campaign excluded.
- User has decided claude-review retirement; generic review design/atomic cutover is subsequent E, outside this PR. E uses existing fleet deep-reasoner role, cross-preferred owner-aware harness selection, explicit override; cross is not acceptance gate. R6/quota/canary remain required before deletion.
