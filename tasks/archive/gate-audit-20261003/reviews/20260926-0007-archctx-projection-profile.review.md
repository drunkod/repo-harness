# Projection profile review

Status: local boundary verified; formal acceptance/adoption pending. Base: `6a0977924c4b9d23f503fe9e67a734b77e1b8f77`.

Standard review covered the entire provider/test diff and workflow artifacts. Target discovery uses only explicit profile identity and canonical contract targets. Registry resolution, source ownership, snapshot/mode/receipt gates and result target containment are unchanged. Sibling callers are snapshot capture, orchestration and result-authority validation; all use the corrected target discovery. Independent read-only security review passed for this boundary.

Verification: 72 provider/orchestration tests pass (389 assertions), typecheck passes; hooks, helpers, reference configs, deploy SQL, architecture sync, task workflow, project-state inspection and init dry-run pass. Task sync passes after recording its requested substantive hash in the canonical notes. Real initialized ArchContext/daemon ChangeSet paired target agreement passes.

No AcceptanceReceipt, installed runtime proof, release or merge. ArchContext existing writer policy blocks ADR migration and root contract projections; both failed live migration attempts rolled back, and ten original files are byte-identical. No guard was changed to manufacture acceptance. No doc debt beyond this explicit adoption prerequisite.

- Summary: Reviewed the approved campaign fixture delta against the previously accepted projection consumer: automatic maintenance is disabled locally before fixture mutations, with a real Git trace positive control and executed red-green regression. Full closeout tests and all 14 frozen contract criteria pass. Daemon-generated manifest preserves model and flow-proof identities. No product closeout semantics, dependency versions or snapshot error handling changed. Hosted CI and release are separate gates.
- Findings: none
