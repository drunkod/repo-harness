## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pending
- Change type: code-change; S2 request/receipt identity and offline cutover behavior.
- Intended files changed: contract exact allowed_paths; unchanged lower admission/assertion/offer revision.
- Actual files changed: shared C error ownership, engineer CLI/MCP transports, eight existing fixture files, one docs-only durable runbook and four workflow artifacts; exact paths remain contract-scoped.
- Check IDs and evidence disposition: canonical plan owns 19 executable checks including check:type; `.ai/harness/checks/e1-s2-verification.latest.json`.
- Residual risks: operator quiescence/readback required, no live migration/canary, no quota/GC or S3/S4.
- Reviewer action required: inspect immutable Draft subject and canonical evidence; formal AcceptanceReceipt remains unavailable, not fabricated.
- Rollback: revert the reviewed branch diff on `feat/e1-selected-receipt`; preserve protocol-2 receipts, seals, fences, observation references and campaign records. Stop producers before any operational rollback. Do not restore a v1 writer against a sealed store or delete unknown evidence to make rollback pass.

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: owner-approved S2 work-package → preflight consumer audit → shared C/one-shot cutover → two bounded feedback batches → canonical verification → Draft PR #470. This execution owner supplies review materials, not reviewer acceptance.
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: plan and notes freeze ownership, concrete path, frozen-time consumer audit and explicit no-compat cutover rationale.
- Root cause or plan evidence: approved plan and contract; second-batch scope extension precedes implementation. The durable runbook records the full campaign inventory/quiescence counterexample, ledger fault ownership and frozen-time safety trace.

## Verification Evidence

Follow [Testing Policy and Artifact Standards](../../docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md#testing-policy-and-artifact-standards).
Consume canonical evidence; do not rerun checks to populate this review or
copy the executable plan. Return missing/stale evidence to its execution owner.

- Waza `/check` review reference, when required: designated reviewer re-gate pending; prior user-reported PASS applies to 3cf3ea04, not this follow-up tree. No review verdict is inferred from test success.
- Check IDs and disposition (executed / exact reuse / baseline with delta / failed / missing / not run): consume the 19-check canonical report `.ai/harness/checks/e1-s2-verification.latest.json`; final dispositions and immutable per-command runs are recorded there, not duplicated as an executable plan here.
- Verified subject, relevant environment and immutable execution references: isolated `repo-harness-e1-selected-receipt`, branch `feat/e1-selected-receipt`; canonical report binds its execution snapshot and immutable `.ai/harness/runs/` paths. Target/normalized subject fields above are reserved for the reviewer.
- Historical baseline and current delta references, if applicable: frozen-time source baseline dc77b3c6; PR base 281e6555; first feedback batch 77f30c35. All admission/assertion/offer-revision source files remain unchanged.
- Manual observations, failures and coverage limitations: baseline audit source dc77b3c6; pure T1/T2 proof exit 0; unchanged A/canonical offer code; selected has no production caller. Historical heavy campaign tests use existing package timeout 60000ms; the initial bare bun test default 5000ms was insufficient and was not treated as a product regression.
- Implementation notes reviewed, if present: full consumer audit, migration/callback/R1 boundaries and release limitations in task notes.
- Run snapshot: each canonical result names its immutable `run_file`; preparation of an AcceptanceReceipt is separate from execution evidence.

## Manual Check Evidence

Copy each non-built-in contract `manual_checks` requirement exactly. Check it only after
the observation is complete and replace the placeholder with concrete command output,
screenshot/artifact path, or reviewer observation.

- [ ] Exact manual_checks requirement
  - Evidence: concrete observation, command output, screenshot path, or reviewer note

- Summary: No AcceptanceReceipt has been recorded.
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Relative to main, stale-then-empty returns `engineer_no_eligible_offer` and deletes its receipt under the key lock; campaign maps it to `action: idle`.

- Inner/campaign operator inspect/migrate commands expose existing exports with explicit inventory digest, quiescence evidence and exact persisted intent. No selected production route is introduced.
- Ledger file faults preserve ledger-specific error codes through CLI/MCP. Missing/corrupt policy authority uses policy codes, not missing observation.
- Campaign auto-seal remains withheld: planning inventory is shared/nonempty and no old-producer retirement proof exists. The durable runbook names the explicit release prerequisite and legacy-parser removal trigger.
- Frozen-time boundary guards cover Board diagnostic liveness, retry attention and snapshot freshness; lease/attempt/authority/torn-snapshot negative controls still refuse.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Quiescence is a trusted operator attestation; every campaign intent requires explicit seal/readback before acquisition. Unknown planning payload semantics need operator review; migration success is not universal semantic proof.
- Tests use production boundary functions with injected Board/plan readers and final ME-0B acquire; they do not prove real Board IO/claim mutation or live migration.
- No quota/GC, cross-store atomic commit, S3 membership/post-effect strengthening or S4 selected transport is included. Retention remains closeout/recovery-owned; 30s is admission-start freshness only.
- Formal AcceptanceReceipt and this follow-up reviewer verdict remain unavailable. Recommendation/verdict fields are not authored by the execution owner.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | pending | Reviewer assessment required |
| Product depth | pending | Reviewer assessment required |
| Design quality | pending | Reviewer assessment required |
| Code quality | pending | Reviewer assessment required |

## Failing Items

- Reviewer-owned verdict/AcceptanceReceipt pending; execution verification failures, if any, are authoritative only in the canonical report.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: the contract Verification Plan on the reviewed tree if evidence becomes stale.
- Re-check: operator scope, full inventory/quiescence preconditions, typed fault ownership, immutable source preservation and frozen-time negative controls; do not treat Draft status or tests as acceptance.

## Summary

- Execution materials are complete for the designated reviewer. No AcceptanceReceipt, Recommendation or verdict has been issued by this execution owner; PR remains Draft, with no merge, Ready, finish or S3.
