## Why

Campaign selector filtering does not prove that a caller-chosen offer belongs to the current intent/group or that callback context remains current. S3 keeps owner authority, unknown-effect fences and exact compensation while preventing R1 success from impersonating new R2 semantics.

## Goal

Implement owner-computed R2 membership/context guards before acquisition and before callback completion/replay, preserve plain acquisition and durable budget/receipt ordering, and type ledger cutover-required refusal with existing MCP mapping. Deliver a verified Draft PR only.

## Scope

- In scope: approved GAP3/GAP4/S3 row; campaign R2 and same-key R1 conflict, trusted owner guard, exact own-claim compensation, callback/pending/outer replay/budget ordering, typed ledger cutover-required error and existing regression tests; document actual lock coverage/limits.
- Out of scope: S4 production selected transports; lower admission, 13-field assertion, offer revision; new compatibility/schema migration, benchmarks/test files/test docs, dependencies, scheduler, GC, primary checkout edits, merge/Ready/finish and fabricated Receipt.
- Taste constraints: existing stores, context keys and callback/coordination ports; no compatibility alias or new authority registry.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

Any off-manifest Task invoking A, R1 completed key executing or replaying as R2, context drift releasing a foreign Lease, or unknown/pending replay invoking effects again falsifies the design. Existing exact receipt/campaign fixtures are the cheapest proof points.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear as a `package_test` check in Verification Plan).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20261002-0033-e1-campaign-membership.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20261002-0033-e1-campaign-membership.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/20261002-0033-e1-campaign-membership.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Exit Criteria (Machine Verifiable)

This block contains only non-executable artifact requirements. Define every
executable check once in the canonical Verification Plan below. Each check must
state its phase, cost, evidence policy, necessity, and input environment; a
missing or malformed plan fails closed. Populate artifact requirements only
for deliverables this task actually owns; do not create a spec, notes or report
merely to fill this template.

Author the actual checks using [Testing Policy and Artifact Standards](../../docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md#testing-policy-and-artifact-standards).
The empty array is not permission to omit required repository checks: retain it
only when no executable criterion applies and explain why in Acceptance Notes.
Prefer existing covering tests; creating a task-named test or adding typecheck
is not a template requirement. For each selected check declare `id`, `kind`,
`cwd`, `phase`, `cost`, `evidence_policy`, `necessity`, `inputs.env`, and its
`command` or `path`. Declare the same execution once, including checks nested
inside aggregate scripts. Use `baseline_with_delta` only with an immutable
baseline and named current delta checks; never infer it from paths or command text.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Changed behavior/boundary, existing covering tests and remaining gap: campaign R2 owner guard and precise callback compensation; existing campaign/issue-280/MCP fixtures cover the change. Full publication/Git writer serialization is not asserted.
- New test case/file rationale, or why existing coverage is sufficient: extend existing fixtures only; no new test file or benchmark.
- Selected check IDs and why their coverage is sufficient; omitted coverage: five existing test files plus typecheck and nine required integrity/state/adoption gates; full suite is unnecessary outside this bounded slice.
- Full/expensive check justification and expected cost, if applicable: existing historical campaign fixtures use package timeout 60000 per test; canonical executor uses a 600000 aggregate helper timeout, without bypass.
- Execution/baseline references, subject, current delta and disposition: baseline dba184d9; .ai/harness/checks/e1-s3-verification.latest.json binds actual final tree and per-command runs.
- Residual risks and incomplete observations: authority sampled before/after, separate publication/Git writers; multiple stores have no global atomic commit; no live canary or typed semantic acceptance is claimed.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: origin/main dba184d9
- Revert strategy: revert this reviewed branch diff; preserve pending/completed/fence and claim/outer-budget evidence, never erase unknown transactions or restore transparent R1 replay.
