## Why

User-approved generic review needs a Receipt independent of reviewer launch transport, retaining the existing production authority and domain-verification protection.

## Goal

Complete launcher-independent generic-review Receipt binding and wire fleet deep-reasoner review through task-agent; preserve three-round/domain/close-fence rules, remove exactly the approved six exclusive legacy files and update their shared consumers atomically.

## Scope

- In scope: existing schema/policy/functions and byte-identical helper projection, existing test consumers/fixture builders, canonical gates, actual RUN2/RUN3 notes and the approved DELETE6 / EDIT36 / RETAIN27 cutover inventory.
- Out of scope: hand-written vendor adapters/argv/output parsers, OAR upstream changes, new model requests or canary items, campaign implementation, the three retained cross-review source files, global config/trust edits, main checkout/user pane changes, merge.

## Stop Conditions

Any workflow gate requiring an unresolved user decision is reported, not bypassed. The user has approved the traced DELETE6 / EDIT36 / RETAIN27 inventory; delete only those six after generic wiring. All source verification stays zero-model. Local commits only. Push/PR/merge are not authorized. Aimpact 18:41 releases reviewer-written result_ref and stock OAR Claude bypass only inside proved inherited OS isolation. Aimpact 20:30 supersedes that knob: delete inherited OAR_CODEX_SANDBOX before Session creation, use stock default danger-full-access with cwd=output, protected only by admitted Seatbelt. Zero-prompt native startup is authorized; no model prompts. Grok is unsupported. Retired Receipt source names have no alias. No launcher-specific field enters validity.

## Falsifier

A required Receipt field that can be tampered without verifier rejection, or a launch-dependent byte/validity difference, fails this slice.

## Root Cause Evidence

Not applicable: approved schema implementation, not a production bugfix.

## Exit Criteria
```yaml
exit_criteria:
  - Both approved RUN3 large cases produce a valid collected Result.
  - Receipt is written and verified through production functions, with fixed-time launcher-independent fixture bytes and required-field tamper rejections.
  - Existing RUN3 zeroSandbox assertion passes, custom-profile OS denial only.
  - Focused tests and required checks pass or exact gate decision/failure is reported without bypass.
  - Exact18-file retirement inventory is shown with refs/replacement plan, no deletion.
```

## E2 approval boundary

Gatekeeper Receipt round 2 PASS is recorded from the user. E2 wires review on task-agent/fleet, preserves domain findings/three rounds/close fence, then deletes the approved six files. Cross-review CLI/core/runner are RETAIN and must be retired only in a separate follow-up after E2 merges. Two named Active contracts are re-frozen in place; no historical receipt is translated. Local full suite, type and Required Checks precede commit/push/PR; skip GitHub CI, no merge without Aimpact.

## B release / mandatory holds

Advisor released B steps 1–6 locally. Concrete mechanism: macOS /usr/bin/sandbox-exec Seatbelt policy around the OAR host execution tree; no third-party sandbox library. Output tree is the only writable filesystem tree; subject, primary, owner record, journal and Git common dir deny, including host descendants and symlink/traversal escapes. Zero-model isolation must pass before SDK host implementation; failure stops the work. No fallback to chmod/worktree/fingerprints.

Historical 18:41 decision (runtime mode/startup/type superseded below at 20:30): reviewer authors result_ref; append only the communication exception through OAR SessionOptions.appendSystemPrompt, leaving RECOMMENDATION-first fleet content intact. Host root-turn text is observation only. Codex host env fixes workspace-write before Session creation, cwd=output; OS Seatbelt remains the sole write-protection authority. Stock OAR Claude bypass is authorized only under the proved inherited OS boundary; Grok is not wired. Claude actual_model is only init-derived in this OAR snapshot and cannot mint Receipt until upstream gap is closed. No launcher fields in Receipt. Local commits only; no remote operations or main changes.


## Aimpact 20:30 D2/D3/D4 release

Finish advisor corrections (a)(b)(c) first: preserve red fixture, only proved /dev/null device exception plus output-local TMPDIR, and OAR installation solely in Node host. Then D2 deletes inherited OAR_CODEX_SANDBOX before Session creation and uses stock default danger-full-access, admitted outer Seatbelt required. D3 is a zero-prompt native startup probe through OAR with real HOME; only OS-log-proved pure session/log/cache directories may become narrow allowances. Settings/hooks/trust/instructions/definitions/credentials remain denied; never redirect HOME or copy credentials. Unsupported native startup stays closed. D4 explicitly authorizes skipLibCheck true, including unchecked src/operator-web/styles.d.ts. Native/model evidence limitations remain recorded; local commits only.

Introduced full-suite failure decision: merge-base hook bundle wiring is 7/7 green; E2 adds the required OAR prepack build. Exact existing test path admitted before editing, only preserve all build stdout redirections and packaged OAR host assertion. No hook production change or new test file.


## Aimpact 23:07 Codex exact state admission

Authorize only ~/.codex/tmp/ subpath and literal state_5.sqlite / logs_2.sqlite,
each with -wal/-shm. No goals_1.sqlite family, config/auth/trust/instructions/
rules/skills grant. Prove the exact positive and negative paths with inherited
Seatbelt fixture, then one zero-prompt real Codex OAR startup probe. If goals
or a new denied path is still requested, stop and report; never widen. Real
HOME retained, no credential/config copying or CLI arg/parser integration.
Local commit only, no push/PR/merge. Existing JSON focused/required checks apply;
no new full-suite request or model round is implied.


## Aimpact 23:29 exact additions

Lift HOLD only for goals_1/memories_1/queue_1 SQLite families (each base/-wal/-shm)
and installation_id as ten additional literals. Same realpath and symlink
refusal, no mixed-root grant, forbidden regex precedence unchanged. One Codex
zero-prompt startup, no Claude rerun; new refusal means stop without expansion
or relaunch. Aimpact accepts the unverified later-session channel via goals and
memories; real-turn state-path sufficiency is also unverified. Local commit only.


## Aimpact 23:56 single lock subpath

Add only realpath ~/.codex/thread-writer-locks as a subpath, requiring an existing
non-symlink directory and non-symlink .codex. All literals and forbidden-regex
precedence unchanged, no mixed-root grant. Extend inherited positive/negative
fixture, then one zero-prompt Codex startup (real HOME). New denial stops, no
expansion/relaunch/Claude rerun. Prior accepted goals/memories channel and real
turn path sufficiency remain unverified. Local commit only.


## Aimpact 2026-10-03 00:27 isolated CODEX_HOME

Read/follow e2-codex-home-risk.md. Owner prepares output/.codex-home 0700 and
exclusive no-follow auth-only copy 0600; only exp checked for full run window,
never log/hash/record credential content or token paths. CODEX_HOME via OAR
SessionOptions.env only, no argv or HOME/config/trust copy. Remove every real
.codex state allowance. Owner auth-copy cleanup on close/cancel/start failure/
timeout; failed removal is cleanup_pending. Existing forbidden regex retains
auth/config write denial. One zero-prompt probe, then only if it passes exactly
one real Codex review round18 through production generic review/Receipt writer/
verifier, private task-proof Herdr session, disposable repo/authority. Any auth
error/refresh or real-home/config/trust requirement stops, no retry/second turn/
Claude run. No source-file deletion/remote/merge; local commits only. Risk pointer
and evidence in slice notes. Zero-model implementation tests precede live work.


## Aimpact 2026-10-03 04:47 observation authority repair

Fix the demonstrated reviewer-authored observation vulnerability, add regression
coverage, run check:type and related tests with --timeout 60000
--max-concurrency 1, then push this PR branch. No Ready transition or merge of
this or any other PR is authorized in this follow-up. Aimpact owns the merge.

The current boundary separates the trusted OAR host from its sandboxed native
reviewer: host completion/model and ready/ack/disposed evidence are published
only in the protected owner review journal. OAR probes an immutable owner-held
Seatbelt executable launcher and still owns all vendor argv and native protocol.
No reviewer-writable observation fallback or legacy-session translation exists.
The child cannot signal the host or connect to Unix control sockets. This
supersedes the earlier host-wide Seatbelt arrangement for the current candidate.
Zero-model source/transport tests only; no new live reviewer/model round.
