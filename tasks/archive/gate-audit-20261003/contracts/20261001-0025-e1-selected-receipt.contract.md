## Why

Existing v1 acquisition identities cannot safely preserve host choice, session, trusted observation and callback-policy evidence across replay. S2 must preserve unknown-effect fences and unchanged admission.

## Goal

After a safe frozen-time audit, add same-module shared C core and acquireSelectedEngineerTask, one-shot inner/outer identity cutover with no permanent v1 reader, R1 callback-policy identity, retained observation refs and typed observation errors/MCP mapping. No production selected transport wiring.

## Scope

- In scope: preflight frozen-time audit, S2 row and GAP2 identity cutover only, existing callback semantics R1, observation errors; owner-approved second batch: operator cutover CLI/runbook, ledger-specific faults, frozen-time regression guards and execution review materials.
- Scope extension rationale: engineer CLI exposes existing inspect/migrate exports without selected dispatch; existing CLI/Fleet/effective-state tests prove the operator and audited boundaries; the docs-only reference runbook preserves migration and audit authority outside task notes. Campaign auto-seal is not added: full planning inventory is normally nonempty before acquisition and producer quiescence cannot be inferred from missing acquisition-shaped records.
- Out of scope: GAP3/4 strengthening (S3), S4 selected entrypoints, lower admission/13-field assertion/offer_revision changes, quota/GC, scheduler, primary checkout, release/merge/Ready.
- Taste constraints: reuse existing modules/ports, locks, canonical primitives and stores; no permanent compatibility reader or invented metadata.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop immediately if any frozen-time consumer is unsafe; report the counterexample before production changes.
- Stop if migration cannot preserve all old logical keys/outer results without guessing or automatic replay.
- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

A current-authority case admitted at old T1 but denied at T2 solely because frozen time relaxes safety falsifies the precondition. Old pending or completed keys executing again, or expired/missing observations resetting a known key, falsify the transaction design.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear as a `package_test` check in Verification Plan).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20261001-0025-e1-selected-receipt.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20261001-0025-e1-selected-receipt.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/20261001-0025-e1-selected-receipt.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Exit Criteria (Machine Verifiable)

This block contains only non-executable artifact requirements. Define every
executable check once in the canonical Verification Plan below. Each check must
state its phase, cost, evidence policy, necessity, and input environment; a
missing or malformed plan fails closed. Populate artifact requirements only
for deliverables this task actually owns; do not create a spec, notes or report
merely to fill this template.

Author the actual checks using [Testing Policy and Artifact Standards](../../docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md#testing-policy-and-artifact-standards).
The empty array is not permission to omit required repository checks: retain it
only when no executable criterion applies and explain why in Acceptance Notes.
Prefer existing covering tests; creating a task-named test or adding typecheck
is not a template requirement. For each selected check declare `id`, `kind`,
`cwd`, `phase`, `cost`, `evidence_policy`, `necessity`, `inputs.env`, and its
`command` or `path`. Declare the same execution once, including checks nested
inside aggregate scripts. Use `baseline_with_delta` only with an immutable
baseline and named current delta checks; never infer it from paths or command text.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Changed behavior/boundary, existing covering tests and remaining gap:
- New test case/file rationale, or why existing coverage is sufficient:
- Selected check IDs and why their coverage is sufficient; omitted coverage:
- Full/expensive check justification and expected cost, if applicable:
- Execution/baseline references, subject, current delta and disposition:
- Residual risks and incomplete observations:

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: origin/main 151ba8f9
- Revert strategy: preserve ledger/evidence; never restore v1 execution or erase fenced old keys. Rollback needs explicit closeout/reconciliation, not automatic replay.
