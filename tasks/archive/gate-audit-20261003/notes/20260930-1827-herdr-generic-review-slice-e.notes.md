## Design Decisions

- ...

## Deviations From Plan Or Spec

- None recorded.

## Tradeoffs Considered

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| ... | ... | ... |

## Open Questions

- None.

## Evidence Links

- Checks: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`

## Promotion Filter

Promote a candidate to `tasks/lessons.md`, `docs/researches/`, or harness asset files only when all three hold: hard to reverse, surprising without local context, and a real trade-off existed. If any one is missing, keep it in this notes file instead.

## Promotion Candidates

- Promote to `tasks/lessons.md` only after a repeated correction or failure pattern.
- Promote to `docs/researches/` only when it is durable repo knowledge with evidence.
- Promote to harness asset files only after verification across more than one task or fixture.

## RUN2/RUN3 actual outcomes and frozen exit scope (20261002)

- RUN2-write af200aff/cd1e2cba/dd8e7ca2 ran once: Claude Sonnet(sonnet-5-5) and Codex each completed three same-task/provider rounds with authored domain-shaped Result, exact request/context validation and immutable owner collection; first Claude write gate passed; fingerprints unchanged, cleanup closed. Six sends consumed, aggregate15/17. Codex-large startup then showedUpdate now/Skip menu and ambiguous_launch before send; Claude-large not started. No retry/config edit/prompt answer. Raw: `.ai/harness/runs/review-design/run2-live-55a23dbd-68e1-41bf-b6e1-ad0c10b85745/{claude-review,codex-review,codex-large,final,post-run-readback}.json`.
- RUN3-write43e6e14f/ff1624cd/d022a7fe ran once after approved trust/version dismissal done by advisor: codex-large then claude-large each one valid collected Result, exit0/final.failed=false; two sends, aggregate17/17. Both dense packets1,048,617bytes, both cleanup closed and recorded provider PID absent. Condition1 passes by valid collection; complete ingestion remainsUNVERIFIED even when provider saysfull. Raw: `.ai/harness/runs/review-design/run3-live-41e58daa-0ca9-4745-8bfc-ed4dcb2c32ec/{codex-large,claude-large,final,post-run-readback,zero-sandbox}.json`.
- Condition3 is the existingzeroSandbox assertion only: real standalone Codex executable, custom privateprofile, paired protected-path EPERM plus writable-cwd positivecontrol; proves custom-profile OS denial only, NOT production workspace-write isolation. No new sandbox test/canary was added.
- Nonblocking follow-ups under the user's scopefreeze: git diff/show --output hole; full large-packet ingestion; hooks isolation; campaign A; production workspace-write sandbox isolation; production role dispatcher/domain Receipt integration, no-file-lookup persistence proof, effective model/effort certification and other previouslyUNVERIFIED capabilities. No extra canary gates, no automatic model requests beyond cap17. Claude remains Sonnet/allowlist+fingerprint, never Opus-proven or OS read-only. Campaign code stays out of this slice.
- Receipt implementation is zero-model: production writer/verifier fixture opinion only, never converts RUN2revise intoPASS; added request/context/result binding and actualharness/role/model checked against owner-held domain Result. No requiredlauncher metadata. Historical projection text remains byte-frozen and display-only; retired source labels cannot pass current receipt verifier.
- No files have been deleted; E2must show traced deletion candidates and shared-reference replacements to the user first.

## Receipt slice evidence and inventory handoff (zero-model)

- ProductionrecordAcceptance/verifyAcceptance now bind request_id/context_sha256/result_sha256 and actual_harness/role/model to an owner-held domain Result, sourcegeneric-review only; no launcher metadata. Identical fixed-time Herdr/headless fixture opinions produced identical verified Receipt bytes, and all six required fields rejected tampering; userwaiver keeps explicitlynull review fields. Proofcache `.ai/harness/runs/review-design/receipt-launcher-independent-proof.json` is labelledfixture opinion, not a real modelPASS.
- Focused118 tests/1522assertions passed (9existing files,101.20s); type and all requiredintegrity checks passed. Raw reports and sha256s in `.ai/harness/runs/review-design/receipt-required/results.json`; task-sync both workingtree and CImerge-base boundaries are acknowledged, no waiver. Historicalarchive projection remains byte-frozen display-only, not an accepted oldsource alias.
- Cutover inventory after user clarification is not an18 quota: actual6DELETE conditional on parity/import removal,36EDIT sharedconsumers,27RETAIN history/independent or negative coverage. Evidence `.ai/harness/runs/review-design/cutover-inventory.{md,json}` plus grep/reverse refs. No deletion, commit, push or merge. E2awaits user seeing inventory; normal obsolete claude-review caller still names retiredsource and must be replaced, not silently routed to newauthority.

## Gatekeeper corrections scope decision

- The user explicitly authorized remaining-source consumer migration; allowed_paths is widened only to checks-materializer, prompt-handler/callers, contract and reference-config source/mirrors, workflow-state and grader source/mirrors, and existing dependent tests/trace fixtures. No src/** or unrelated runtime scope. Preflight must pass before those edits.
- Generic review's sole domain role is deep-reasoner by the approved product contract; a single exported constant in the Receipt authority defines that closed validity rule, not a second model/effort/profile configuration. Both validators use it; callers cannot select another role by editing fleet config or input.
- The owner-held reviewed Result is required for verifier-side digest and request/context/harness/role/model comparison; a digest stored only in the Receipt would have no independent original to check. The canonical path uses repo/authorityHome, not launch details. --review-result is mandatory only for the external record CLI input; direct API takes the same domain object. User waiver remains its separate grant path.
- claude-review-session.ts is not patched: its retired source/missing domain Result call is a CRITICAL interim ship blocker. It must be removed with generic review wiring in the same PR before ship. Its exclusive test is a DELETE candidate, so REPO_HARNESS_TEST_EXPENSIVE is not enabled and the obsolete suite is not run. No deletion in this correction pass.

- Scope refinement from the source-consumer audit: exact paths added for evidence-checks-materializer, evidence-projection-drift, helper-script-fixture, plan-to-todo and prompt-handler tests. These positive consumers must migrate with the production source change; no new test file or unrelated behavior. Historical archive fixtures and explicit old-source rejection cases stay unchanged.

- Required hook projection check identified the tracked generated digest marker .ai/hooks/.projection.json; added that exact projection path to allowed_paths before regeneration. This is the deterministic marker of the authorized workflow-state source change, not a new runtime consumer.

## Gatekeeper FAIL corrections: final evidence (zero-model)

- Gatekeeper verdict remains FAIL pending re-review, not self-issued PASS. All named current source consumers plus traced positive dependent fixtures now use generic-review; old labels remain only in explicit rejection coverage, byte-frozen historical fixtures and the intentionally unpatched legacy session. Exact allowed_paths widened before edits and preflight passed; no file deleted.
- Final frozen source run: 229 tests / 0 fail / 2538 assertions across 17 existing files, 210.6s. Raw .ai/harness/runs/review-design/gate-fix-focused-frozen.log, sha256:4a532a3b70c6680c3cff693eae8d9f30e21f1628224c87960fc728bfbc8637c1.
- check:type and all nine Required Checks exit 0; CI merge-base task-sync also exit 0. Canonical command/exit/report/hash manifest: .ai/harness/runs/review-design/gate-fix-canonical-results.json. Six authoring/projection pairs are byte-identical, git diff --check clean. Both task-sync boundaries acknowledged; no waiver.
- Six tamper mutations now require their own exact field-specific mismatch; stored claude-review and codex-review receipts reject via production readReceipt with source is invalid. Fixed-time Herdr/headless labels remain diagnostics for fixture opinions only, no live launches or real verdict certification.
- CRITICAL ship blocker is explicitly in the plan: delete claude-review-session with generic review wiring in the same PR before ship; do not patch that caller. tests/claude-review.test.ts remains a deletion/replacement candidate and was not run with REPO_HARNESS_TEST_EXPENSIVE. No provider/model calls, deletion, commit, push or merge in this correction pass.

## E2 authorized boundary

- User reports Gatekeeper Receipt round 2 PASS; implementation and explicit six-file deletion now authorized, same PR. Exact inventory + replacement paths added to contract before edits. Cross-review CLI/core/runner remain untouched; their retirement is a separate follow-up after E2 merges. No new canary/model calls or campaign work.
- Re-freeze the two named Active contracts in place to the existing valid generic-review policy schema (Codex protocol2, Claude protocol1); no historical receipt alias/translation or acceptance is minted.

- E2 first proof before deletion: 22 tests / 0 fail / 481 assertions, .ai/harness/runs/review-design/e2-wiring-proof.log. Only deterministic provider effects; production acceptanceContext/recordAcceptance/verifyAcceptance and persisted close fence ran normally. Deleted exactly the six approved exclusive files afterward.
- Harness selection must not make cross a hard acceptance gate: expected_reviewer retains the frozen preferred policy; actual reviewer is Claude/Codex joined to actual_harness and the owner-held domain Result. Explicit same-harness and only preflight-missing fallback have production writer/verifier fixture coverage. Requested/actual/fallback reason remain in runtime evidence; launcher details never enter Receipt validity.
- Production role pins use the existing fleet parser and Codex target override; Claude argv has no LF, strict empty MCP, exact three result-file Write permission rules. Native logs supply actual model; unavailable/ambiguous model evidence fails closed. No new host/adapter/registry. Fingerprints detect edits, not OS isolation; hooks and production workspace-write isolation remain unverified follow-ups.
- Local full suite explicitly authorized by the user: reuse the existing bounded per-file runner (4 processes, concurrency 1, timeout 120000ms), without invoking GitHub CI or enabling expensive real install/provider lanes. This avoids shared process fixture state while covering every discovered test file; gated skips are reported as skipped, never passed.

- Review budget keys use canonical contract path under Git primary-root state, not execution cwd. Session freezes owner_root outside Receipt validity, so changing linked owner checkout cannot reset three-round accounting. This is the existing cross-worktree recovery/budget invariant, not another launcher abstraction.

- Updated E branch onto origin/main 9aef6693 with rebase/autostash of this worktree's owned changes only; no conflicts and no main-checkout mutation. The two incoming engineer changes remain upstream scope, not E2 PR changes.
- First local full run covered all 457 files (1436.84s), exit1: five failed files, all outside E2. Three are unsupported default Node26/ArchContext runtime; Node24-only diagnostic passed 48/48. Campaign fixture had an explicit 60000ms timeout under 4-process load; operator summary compared live wall-clock metrics at distinct times. No unrelated code/test fix. Final canonical run uses installed Node24.21.0 as a subprocess-only override and two isolated processes, same 120000ms case timeout. No global config/install changes, no GitHub CI run.

- Read-only owner inference check: Herdr agent get accepts a pane selector; the existing advisor pane reports agent=claude with name=null. Generic inference therefore queries the exact parent pane and joins pane_id/terminal_id rather than requiring an agent name. No provider start, prompt or default workspace mutation.
- Aimpact approval 14:33: remote scope is feature-branch push plus DRAFT PR only. No main mutation/push, no force-push, no merge; rollback and local evidence in PR body, no attribution footer.

- Bounded lifecycle review kept shared endpoint preflight ahead of generic state creation and used the existing canonical JSON utility for persisted endpoint comparison. The three-round writer/verifier fixture now reorders endpoint keys between turns, guarding against falsely rejecting the same address. No new canary or launcher mechanism.

- Shared classifier projection consumes actual external reviewer, not the frozen preferred reviewer, for generic-review. This aligns the existing EDIT classifier/helper with explicit/fallback harness selection and keeps retired sources rejected; the existing retained classifier test remains in place with its current-source assertion updated.

## B implementation release / holds

- Concrete OS mechanism selected for first proof: macOS built-in /usr/bin/sandbox-exec with Seatbelt policy; no third-party library, no chmod fallback. Host descendants must inherit denial; output tree alone writable. Native tool flags do not certify this boundary.
- H1 result delivery HOLD: deep-reasoner RECOMMENDATION first cannot become JSON-only by stripping, regex or instruction rewrite. No publisher is implemented until decision.
- H2 Claude unsupported even inside OS sandbox because stock OAR bypass flag violates standing policy. No automatic fallback; Codex only. Grok not added. Claude actual_model comes from system/init only (OAR projection.ts:235–237), not assistant model; no Claude Receipt until gap is closed.
- Readonly implementation stages use scriptedRuntime/dummy processes only. No model/provider, main/default/mini/global-config/OAR-repo changes. Only local commits authorised.


## B / 18:41 implementation checkpoint — blocked on SDK declarations

- P1: task-agent owns Herdr workspace/pane and typed execution-owner proof; OAR 0.10.2 owns vendor installation/argv/native events and Session lifecycle; the existing acceptance functions own subject/request/context/result binding and Receipt validity. Receipt stays launcher-independent. macOS Seatbelt, not sandbox_mode or fingerprints, is the write-protection authority.
- P2: prepared owner packet + durable request → fixed sandbox-exec/Node24 host in visible pane → OAR SessionOptions(fleet + one result-write authorization, cwd=output) → one SDK prompt per file request with ACK → reviewer-written TaskResult → existing readTaskRequestResult/collectTaskResult → domain validation/recordAcceptance → normal Receipt verifier → SDK disposal ack + execution-owner exit → created pane cleanup. Terminal text is observation, never extracted Result. Three requests share one Session; fourth rejected; ambiguous delivery never replays.
- P3: Aimpact 18:41 supersedes the earlier H1/H2 holds in this file and ffdaa41b's historical plan snapshot. Codex host env fixes OAR_CODEX_SANDBOX=workspace-write before Session creation. The output tree alone is writable; subject is referenced by absolute path. Claude's bypass flag comes from stock OAR and is permitted only inside the proved inherited OS boundary. No app-added bypass or native argv. Claude system/init (OAR projection.ts:235–237) is not actual gateway model: production admission fails with review_actual_model_unverified instead of minting a requested-alias Receipt. Grok and non-Darwin production paths stay unsupported.
- New dependency @botiverse/oar is exact-pinned 0.10.2 to replace the four hand integrations. New review-isolation.ts owns the cross-process write invariant; new oar-review-host.ts is necessary for the Node>=24 SDK execution boundary, persistent Session and visible standard events. No adapter registry or vendor parser was added. At larger payload scale, SDK retained events and pane history remain observation pressure; three-round/10MB request bounds remain unchanged, full ingestion is unverified.
- First proof: production reviewIsolationPolicy emitted Seatbelt policy; dummy Node24 host and descendant each attempted seven writes (five protected authorities, symlink, traversal). All returned EPERM with unchanged protected bytes; host and child output writes succeeded. This proves this macOS policy/fixture and inheritance, not native vendor versions, arbitrary existing processes, network/read isolation or complete credential/cache behavior. Non-Darwin tests explicitly skip this OS proof (unverified), while admission rejection is tested.
- Host result publication is gone: reviewer writes result_ref; SDK root-turn text, including RECOMMENDATION, is printed only. SDK scriptedRuntime tests cover one Session/three prompts, rejected fourth, actual file Results and dispose. Typed model/state observations are application evidence, not a new native-output parser. binding.host protections remain unchanged; public CLI/MCP args remain empty and the new internal host/file-delivery seams are additive.
- Required typecheck stops this checkpoint: OAR root public declarations pull Pi 0.99.x find.d.ts:7 using missing path.PlatformPath, and gaxios src/gaxios.d.ts:52 overriding fetch without Bun's preconnect member. The final check:type has exactly those two dependency errors and no repo source/test errors. No skipLibCheck, ambient shadow type, node_modules patch, SDK fork, remote OAR change or handwritten adapter workaround. SDK declaration compatibility must be resolved before E2 can pass/ship; this local checkpoint is not a gatekeeper PASS.
- Host build and zero-model focused/CLI/MCP evidence is in b-*.log under review-design; canonical hashes/exit codes are recorded in b-checkpoint-results.json. An intermediate full regression failed at fixture start; it ran the generated host without the required cursor.sessionId. OAR session-kernel.js:69–71 rejects that cursor. The original launch error was wrapped, so this is a code/evidence correlation rather than captured original stderr; rebuilding the corrected host passed the same fixture, with no launch replay. All involved sessions were private task-proof-*; no default/mini/user pane, trusted canary fixture, OAR repo or global config was mutated. No native provider or model calls.
- Previous full-suite evidence remains historical, not this OAR tree's full-suite PASS: final run exit1 (brc10-lifecycle, campaign-acquisition, verify-sprint); no unrelated fixes or new full run were performed after the dependency type gate blocked.
- Normal disposal is proved only with scriptedRuntime in a private pane. Host SIGKILL/native orphan reconciliation, native auth/cache writes under the output-only profile, actual Claude model, hooks and complete delivery remain unverified; no fallback to weaker isolation. Frozen cross-review CLI/core/runner are still unchanged follow-ups after E2 merge; campaign is out of scope.


## Advisor corrections (a)(b)(c) before D2/D3/D4

- Red fixture on 60d7b723 policy: host and descendant each produced stdio ignore spawn EPERM, /dev/null redirect exit1/Operation not permitted, TMPDIR mkdtemp EPERM, nested sandbox-exec exit71/sandbox_apply: Operation not permitted. All fourteen protected-path/symlink/traversal refusals still held. Raw b-correction-isolation-before.log proves the missed operational cases; the prior isolation fixture did not prove OAR could spawn a runtime.
- Minimal corrected policy excludes only the proved /dev/null literal from the deny rule; no /dev/* grant. reviewHostTemporaryDirectory creates and validates a private .tmp under canonical output, rejects symlink/traversal widening, and Node host sets TMPDIR before OAR Session creation. No HOME/config redirects or credential copies. Protected authorities remain denied. Nested sandbox application still fails and is not claimed fixed.
- OAR installation now runs in the fixed Node>=24 host's --installation application mode. The production Bun controller imports host types only and consumes the application InstallationSnapshot; vendor probe args/output remain OAR-owned. A fake executable records its Node parent; no real provider/model is used for this proof.
- Aimpact 20:30 separately releases D2 default danger-full-access under admitted outer Seatbelt, D3 zero-prompt native-state write evidence and narrow state allowances, and D4 skipLibCheck. Those decisions replace earlier holds; finish this correction checkpoint first, then implement them. Current checkpoint is not shippable.


## D2/D3/D4 implementation

- D2 (Aimpact 20:30) replaces workspace-write: delete inherited OAR_CODEX_SANDBOX before each Session creation; stock OAR selects danger-full-access and outer admitted Seatbelt is the only write authority. No vendor arguments are added by the application.
- D4 is an explicit user decision: skipLibCheck true skips body checking for every .d.ts, including src/operator-web/styles.d.ts and SDK/transitive declarations. These declarations still provide usage types; strict source/test checking remains enabled. This is no longer an unresolved or silently bypassed gate.
- D3 probe must send no prompt, preserve real HOME/config/credentials, record raw OS denial paths, and allow only proved pure state subpaths. Forbidden authority surfaces and unknown/unsupported startup stay denied. Native Claude actual_model remains init-only and cannot mint Receipt.

- D3 native startup (real HOME /Users/chris, Node24.21.0, NO prompt): Claude 2.1.284 constructor returned and Session.dispose completed; no model/text turn observed, init actual_model still null. OS denied session-env/sessions, plugin .in_use/data/marketplace locks, fixed /private/tmp sockets/probes, CLI cache, .codegraph telemetry and .claude.json.tmp writes. Because startup succeeded without those grants, they are not proved necessary; no native directory allowance is added. Plugins and .claude.json remain forbidden.
- Codex 0.160.0 installation was available, but Runtime.session failed with app-server exited. OS probe-window logs show ~/.codex/tmp/arg0 and state_5.sqlite/logs_2.sqlite/goals_1.sqlite with WAL/SHM writes denied. These databases are files in a mixed ~/.codex root, not narrow pure-state directories; no broad ~/.codex allowance is made. Codex is unsupported under the current directory-only admission. The very short-lived codex PID was not captured by the 100ms ps sampler, so OS-log/time-window attribution is strongly correlated rather than a captured parent proof; no grant depends on it.
- The OS log probe used (debug deny) only to emit audit events, with the same permission rules as the admitted profile. Both runtime probes retained real HOME, sent no prompt, observed no turn/model call, disposed the returned Claude Session, and left no identity-proven child alive. Evidence: d3-native-startup/results.json, os-sandbox.ndjson, per-kind process/stdout/stderr logs; outputs retained under .ai/harness/runs/d3-native-startup-output. No config, trust or credentials were copied or edited. No further native launch is attempted for Codex.
- D3 policy tests now cover native-dir/authority overlap and forbidden definitions/credentials even inside the writable output tree. This caught a regex reader-escaping error before commit; raw SB regex constants (rather than JSON-escaped regex bodies) fixed it, and all host/descendant denied writes passed. Native-state allowlist remains empty in production and probe.

- Full-suite introduced finding: existing hook bundle test froze prepack to two builds. Merge-base file is 7/7 green; required E2 OAR build makes that exact-string assertion obsolete. Under user-authorized introduced-failure repair, admit tests/unit/hook-entry-single-file-bundle.test.ts before edit and update only wiring/file assertion and its redirect comment. Campaign BRC10 planning.lock failure reproduces on the entire merge-base file (12 pass/4 skip/1 fail); leave it untouched.

- Final local full run: 457 files, 5751 pass / 56 skip / 2 fail, exit1 (capture elapsed 2594.96s). Every failure was rerun on local git-archive merge-base 9aef6693 with frozen base dependencies. BRC10 reproduces unchanged; hook wiring is introduced and fixed, focused file 7/7 green. Only that test assertion/comment changed after the run, no production change; no second expensive full run and no false all-green claim. Full/raw/base/fix hashes are in d234-full-suite.json. No GitHub CI run.


## Aimpact 23:07 Codex state literals / stop

- Allow exactly realpath-resolved ~/.codex/tmp as subpath and state_5.sqlite/logs_2.sqlite plus their -wal/-shm as six literal rules. No subpath/regex on ~/.codex. Refuse symlink .codex root, tmp or any listed file; reject protected-path/literal overlap. Existing forbidden definition/credential regex stays after the deny-by-complement and cannot be overridden. Production generic profile consumes this exact set for Codex only; Claude profile unchanged.
- Fixture proves host and descendant can write tmp and all six literal files, while goals family, config/auth/AGENTS/rules/skills/rest of .codex, original protected authorities, symlink/traversal and output definitions remain denied. Root/tmp/all six symlink rejection is independently covered. Focused domain fixtures use their own short /tmp/as-* home to avoid sun_path overflow; no real HOME/config or server change in these fixtures.
- Exactly one real Codex0.160.0 Runtime.session startup attempt under real HOME with NO prompt. Failed app-server exited; no Session returned to dispose, known process cleanup empty. OS records goals_1.sqlite/-wal/-shm still denied; new memories_1.sqlite/-wal/-shm, queue_1.sqlite/-wal/-shm and installation_id denied. /dev/dtracehelper denial repeats earlier optional startup diagnostics. No widening, no second launch, no Claude rerun. Short-lived native pid not sampled: OS native-name/time-window attribution is correlated, not captured parent proof.
- Retained evidence: d3-codex2307-startup/{report.md,results.json,os-sandbox.ndjson,codex.sb,codex-audit.sb}, execution.log and output under .ai/harness/runs/d3-codex2307-output. One prelaunch guard refusal due stale evidence path happened before any native process; preserved separately. Claude limitation unchanged: prior startup only, real review turn unverified, init-only model cannot mint Receipt. Codex remains unsupported with this approved set. No model round, push, PR or merge.

- 23:07 validation: focused generic/Receipt 30 pass / 670 assertions / 55.14s; type and nine Required Checks pass after current diff binding. No full-suite rerun for this narrowly scoped permission change; previous full run/pre-existing failure classification remains historical. Canonical command/hash evidence is d3-codex2307-checkpoint.json.


## Aimpact 23:29 exact additions and accepted risk

- Add only ten literals: goals_1/memories_1/queue_1 SQLite base/-wal/-shm and installation_id, retaining the previous six literals and tmp subpath. realpath, symlink refusal and forbidden-regex priority unchanged, no subpath/regex on mixed ~/.codex. New literal positives, sibling/authority negatives and every listed symlink tested.
- Aimpact explicitly accepts that a danger-full-access reviewer may write goals_1 and memories_1 that the user's own Codex may consume in later sessions: this is an unverified cross-session channel, not prevented by the outer write profile. A real review turn may require additional state paths; that remains unverified. No Receipt security claim or scope expansion follows from startup success.
- One new zero-prompt Codex startup is authorized, real HOME, standard OAR API, dispose if returned. Any new denial stops with no permission increase or second launch. No Claude rerun; Claude remains startup-only/real-turn-unverified/init-only-model/no Receipt.

- 23:29 single zero-prompt recheck, Codex0.160.0/Node24.21.0/real HOME: thread/start failed with Failed to initialize session, thread-store internal error, Operation not permitted. OS newly denies ~/.codex/thread-writer-locks/.coordination.lock; native pid48603 was captured in process samples. Previously seen /dev/dtracehelper refusals remain optional and unopened. No Session returned for dispose; known process cleanup empty. STOP, no new grant or relaunch. No prompt/model call, no Claude rerun. Retain d3-codex2329-startup/{report.md,results.json,os-sandbox.ndjson,codex.sb,codex-audit.sb} and d3-codex2329-output.

- 23:29 validation: focused generic/Receipt 30 pass / 716 assertions / 59.87s; type and required integrity checks pass after current digest binding. No full-suite rerun or model round. Canonical log/hash manifest: d3-codex2329-checkpoint.json. STOP pending next Aimpact decision; no additional allowance or launch.


## Aimpact 23:56 single lock directory

- Add only thread-writer-locks realpath subpath, requiring .codex and locks to be non-symlink directories. tmp and sixteen literals unchanged; no root subpath or regex grant. Existing config/auth/AGENTS/rules/skills deny-regex stays authoritative. Positive lock-file write plus sibling sessions/decoy negatives and symlink/non-directory tests cover the addition.
- One zero-prompt Codex startup authorized; new OS denial ends scope without extra allowance or relaunch. Real HOME, OAR APIs only, no prompt/model round or Claude rerun. Accepted later-session goals/memories channel and real-turn further-path uncertainty unchanged; Claude startup-only/init-only-model/no Receipt remains.

- 23:56 single Codex0.160.0/Node24.21.0/real HOME probe: Session constructor returned, gpt-6-astra/high SDK init readback, Session.dispose true, exit0/known children gone. NO prompt/model turn. This proves startup/disposal only, not a real review or backend model certification. Native pid20051 sampled.
- New OS refusals: models_cache.json, shell_snapshots cleanup/temp creation, plugin cache/.remote-plugin-install-staging/metadata removal and thread_history_1.sqlite/-wal/-shm. Optional /dev/dtracehelper repeats earlier evidence. Correct STOP despite successful constructor: all new paths remain denied, no additional grant/relaunch/Claude rerun. Plugin namespace remains forbidden. Raw paths in d3-codex2356-startup/report.md and os-sandbox.ndjson; outputs retained under d3-codex2356-output. Accepted goals/memories channel and real-turn path uncertainty unchanged, Claude startup-only/init-only-model/no Receipt unchanged.

- 23:56 validation: focused generic/Receipt 30 pass / 732 assertions / 54.44s, type and nine Required Checks pass after diff binding. No full-suite rerun or model round; no true-turn readiness claim. Manifest d3-codex2356-checkpoint.json.


## Aimpact 00:27 isolated CODEX_HOME

- Risk owner/handling rules: .ai/harness/runs/review-design/e2-codex-home-risk.md (advisor p7, Aimpact 2026-10-03 00:27).
- Remove all real-home state subpath/literal grants, including accepted goals/memories write channel. Owner-only isolated auth copy, 0700/0600, exclusive/no-follow/regular-file checks, exp-only full-window preflight; never credential bytes/hash/token paths in evidence. env seam only, no config/trust/definitions/credential writeback. Failed cleanup remains explicit cleanup_pending.
- Refresh may rotate server-side token before denied persistence; network/read isolation not claimed. Source id-token expiry ignored per risk; only access exp checked. Actual backend model remains SDK-observed label, not backend certification. One zero-prompt startup and only after pass round18, private task-proof session and disposable authority. No second real turn/Claude/config edits/remote operations.

- 00:27 zero-model probe passed with isolated home: constructor/dispose true, no real-home write, no refresh/auth-write denial, auth copy removed by owner. Default isolated config/skills creation was refused but not required for startup; neither copied/created. Real model turn is conditional on this normal startup pass.
- Round18 (exactly one production request) PASSED on disposable arithmetic fixture in private task-proof session: production generic Result/domain validation/recordAcceptance wrote generic-review external_pass; verifyAcceptance and persisted readback matched. actual_harness=codex, actual_role=deep-reasoner, actual_model=gpt-6-astra equals OAR Session.model observation; no launcher field. Actual backend identity beyond SDK observation is not claimed. Private close returned closed/pids[], server stopped, auth copy absent after owner cleanup, no credential write/refresh observed, no Claude run.
- One pre-dispatch fixture preparation gate failed because verification event log was not ignored, changing snapshot despite arithmetic test pass. Added fixture-only runtime ignore boundary and revalidated using production executeVerificationContract; no model/session had started at that point. Model dispatch has an exclusive round18 marker and was never retried. Evidence d3-home0027-startup and round18-review/final.json; credentials are excluded from evidence and hashing, only auth_copied/mode recorded.
- All real-home tmp/locks/sixteen file grants and later-session injection channel are removed. Remaining accepted risks: second copy briefly at rest, read/network exposure, possible server-side refresh rotation before failed persistence, source-token/body declarations unchecked per approved skipLibCheck, crash residue, Claude model gap and future-version/real-turn paths unverified. Normal close/cancel/start-failure/timeout cleanup and cleanup_pending are covered by zero-model production fixtures.

- 00:27 focused validation: 31 pass / 795 assertions, including cleanup close/cancel/start-failure/timeout and delete-refusal; type and nine integrity gates pass after current diff binding. Previous full-suite evidence is historical, no new broad/full/model run. Canonical manifest home0027-checkpoint.json.


## Observation authority repair — Aimpact 2026-10-03 04:47

- P1: the owner orchestrator and Receipt store are trusted; OAR owns provider
  argv/session/model observation; the reviewer owns only its Result outbox. The
  previous host-wide profile gave the host and reviewer identical write rights,
  so an outbox observation could not certify who authored it.
- P2 / root-cause proof: the real acceptance fixture invokes production
  runReviewRound, with a matching reviewer Result plus forged completed/model
  observation. Before the source fix the new regression failed because the
  call resolved and minted a Receipt. The captured red command is
  `bun test tests/acceptance-receipt.test.ts --test-name-pattern 'rejects forged outbox observation' --timeout 60000 --max-concurrency 1`
  (exit 1); local log `/tmp/repo-harness-pr-closeout-20261003/476-regression-red.log`.
  Existing request/hash/schema checks validate identity, not observation origin.
- P3: retain the existing owner journal as the single host-evidence authority.
  OAR probes one immutable owner launcher; the launcher only forwards argv to
  Seatbelt and the OAR-selected native executable. The trusted Node host remains
  outside that child boundary. SIGUSR1 inspection is disabled; child signal and
  Unix socket access are denied to protect host and Herdr control authority.
  ready/ack/observed/disposed use the owner journal together; no outbox fallback.
  Cached old sessions/specs fail closed rather than migrate untrusted evidence.
- Regression coverage: missing genuine completion refuses Receipt; failed
  genuine completion refuses forged PASS; completed genuine observation wins
  over an outbox forged model. An actual OAR codexRuntime/native-protocol fixture
  proves Result writes succeed while seven owner control paths, host signal and
  Unix socket access are denied; both failed and completed OAR outcomes persist
  unchanged in the owner journal. It calls no real model/provider.
- No dependency or source file added. The launcher is ignored runtime state,
  needed only to apply the existing platform boundary at OAR's executable seam;
  vendor arguments and protocol have one owner. No new transport abstraction.
- Native tool self-cancellation under signal denial and a new real model run
  remain unverified; OAR disposal from the trusted host still owns process-group
  termination. This repair does not claim a new real-model acceptance.

- Final local verification for this repair: `bun run check:type` exit 0;
  `bun test tests/generic-review.test.ts tests/acceptance-receipt.test.ts tests/cli/task-agent.test.ts tests/herdr-task-lifecycle.test.ts --timeout 60000 --max-concurrency 1`
  exit 0, 50 pass / 0 fail / 1133 assertions, four files (194.51s). All nine
  root integrity commands exit 0. Logs: `/tmp/repo-harness-pr-closeout-20261003/476-type-final.log`,
  `476-related-final.log`, and `476-integrity-results.json` in the same directory.
  The prior red result and this passing result are separate evidence boundaries.
  Full suite and real-model rounds were not rerun. No Ready/merge in this follow-up.
