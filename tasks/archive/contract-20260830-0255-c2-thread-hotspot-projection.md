## Why

The collaboration substrate stores signals but nothing yet reads them. Without a
deterministic read model, every downstream row (C6 exchange, C7 CLI/MCP, C8
Operator view) would each invent its own aggregation and ranking, and the first
one to read a wall clock would make the same store bytes produce a different
answer on every rebuild. C2 fixes one projection: threads aggregate on exact
opaque key equality, attention ordering is an integer function of committed
bytes, and a context packet is byte-identical for the same input. If this ships
wrong, hotspot heat leaks into scheduling authority or the packet digest stops
being reproducible, and every later row inherits the defect.

## Goal

Deliver the pure C2 read-model layer over the C1 signal store:
`src/core/collaboration/thread-projection.ts`,
`src/core/collaboration/hotspot.ts` and
`src/core/collaboration/context-packet.ts`, plus their three unit test files.
Threads aggregate by exact `thread_key`; hotspot scoring is a total integer
function whose recency term is relative to the deterministic epoch (the latest
`created_at` in the source signal set); contribution opportunities use only the
closed structural reason set; `RelevantSignalV1` carries a closed retrieval
reason plus `matched_refs`; `CollaborationContextPacketV1` is assembled under a
deterministic 60/40 exploitation/exploration quota inside a 1,500 estimated-token
budget with explicit truncation evidence, and carries no `built_at` and no
wall-clock input anywhere in its digest preimage.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - `src/core/collaboration/thread-projection.ts`, `src/core/collaboration/hotspot.ts`, `src/core/collaboration/context-packet.ts`
  - `tests/unit/collaboration-thread-projection.test.ts`, `tests/unit/collaboration-hotspot.test.ts`, `tests/unit/collaboration-context-packet.test.ts`
  - `.archcontext/model/nodes/capability.runtime-harness.collaboration.yaml` entrypoint/verification additions
  - `docs/architecture/modules/runtime-harness/collaboration.md` and `docs/architecture/.projection-manifest.json` re-render when a size bucket moves
  - `tasks/workstreams/runtime-harness/collaboration/` durable progress
- Out of scope:
  - `src/core/collaboration/common.ts` and `src/core/collaboration/signal.ts`: C1-frozen, consumed unchanged; a needed change here stops the task
  - handoff, adoption, receipt, admission-bridge, contribution and exchange code (C3/C4/C6), owned by a sibling worker in parallel
  - any CLI, MCP or Operator surface (C7/C8)
  - any `src/effects/**` file, any store, any cache file, any write path
  - the five program plan and PRD files
  - `AUTHORITY_INVENTORY`, `DELIBERATELY_EXCLUDED` and `FROZEN_INVENTORY_SHA256` in `tests/unit/collaboration-authority-baseline.test.ts`
- Taste constraints: pure functions only, integer arithmetic only in scoring, no floating point in any digested value, no clock read on any path.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

If the same source signal bytes produced two different `packet_sha256` values
across two builds in one process, or if a hotspot score changed when only the
process wall clock advanced, the epoch design is wrong. Cheapest proof point:
`bun test tests/unit/collaboration-context-packet.test.ts --timeout 60000`,
which builds the same packet twice and compares canonical bytes, and drives the
recency path with a fixed synthetic epoch far from any real clock value.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).
