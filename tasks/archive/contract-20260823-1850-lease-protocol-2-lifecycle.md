## Why

The default linked-PR ship leaves the task lease in `completing`, a short crash-ambiguity state that cannot represent days of review. Without a schema-versioned `reviewing` state and exact publication pointer, takeover, feedback, readiness, and provider-driven reconcile either strand ownership or bypass claim/generation fencing.

## Goal

Ship Lease Owner Record Schema 2 and the explicit PR review lifecycle. A successful task-backed linked-PR ship enters `reviewing` only after marker-backed receipt plus `pr_observed` durability; reopen, takeover, abandon, and verified-only legacy migration are task-locked and pointer-fenced; ordinary steal/release/reconcile cannot bypass the lifecycle; `COORDINATION_PROTOCOL` remains `1`.

## Scope

- In scope: strict V1/V2 lease parsing/serialization; `reviewing` and `current_publication`; pure and task-locked enter/reopen/takeover/abandon transitions; immutable lineage; linked-PR journal wiring; board projection; legacy inspect and fully revalidated per-lease migration; focused and full verification.
- Out of scope: WP0-C recovery/provider reconcile, readiness, fleet acquire, feedback, Task Inbox V1, MCP, remote claims, liveness, auto-merge, and any task digest-domain change.
- Taste constraints: Fail closed. Reuse the canonical row parser, task lock, receipt validators, worktree topology reader, and bind sequence. No inferred identity, ref/worktree fallback, marker synthesis, or second authority.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

The direction is wrong if schema-1 owner fixtures no longer parse byte-equivalently, `COORDINATION_PROTOCOL` or digest vectors change, a markerless legacy PR can become reviewing, raw `contract-worktree finish --no-merge` enters reviewing before PR facts exist, or any command other than bind creates fresh bound execution fields. Check the pure transition/parser tests before shell integration.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: Schema 2 review ownership, pointer-fenced lifecycle commands, linked-PR review entry, and board projection passed focused and full-suite verification.
- Edge cases: Crash after `mark-reviewing` but before ship `complete` replays the idempotent review proof without re-entering the completing-only receipt path; markerless legacy publications fail closed.
- Regression risks: WP0-C still owns provider-fetch reconcile and recovery beyond the local ship-journal replay implemented here.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: `70ace994` plus the final workflow-evidence commit.
- Revert strategy: Revert the WP0-B commits as one unit; do not downgrade emitted schema-2 reviewing records through an older CLI.
