# Release preparation decisions

The owner explicitly selected latest-main 0.19.1 after being shown the old
remote tag and npm absence. The tag update will use an exact old-object lease,
not an unconditional force. The previous package version remains 0.19.1.

The mergeable work-package owns documentation and prepared release evidence.
The authorized tag/npm/GitHub/runtime operations occur after its closeout, so
its checklist cannot claim publication before that actually happens.

The existing check:release aggregate is the single expensive execution owner.
It includes all required integrity checks, readme tests and real package smoke;
only the nonduplicate version preflight is declared separately. The tarball
smoke supplies the irreversible-release runtime_readback oracle.

Original main WIP stays in the primary checkout. Other worktrees and deferred
CI hardening items are outside this release.

## Release gate blocked

Candidate `b0bdd6f7674a92dfb3c09055ad70bd526e891ae5` passed the
codex-plugin documentation review with verdict `approve`, no findings and
subject `sha256:76152de1b4aba58bef99031a7ade9daf9a09abb65db398a5c07263bd8e34883a`.
That approval does not authorize treating failed runtime checks as passing.

The canonical release execution completed 138 test files before the parent
stopped it after five files failed in two observed areas. It was interrupted
through its owned process supervisor; the test process group was then absent.
The aggregate did not finish, and tarball smoke was not reached.

- `tests/cli/chatgpt-browser.test.ts:1213`: the Oracle process-tree timeout
  scenario took 12527 ms against the existing less-than-8000 ms assertion.
- `tests/cli/codegraph.test.ts:87` and `tests/cli/doctor.test.ts:467`: the fake
  CodeGraph log contained `codegraph status .` but no `codegraph --version`.
- `tests/cli/codegraph-resolver.test.ts:94`: three probes were returned where
  the fixture expects two. The tooling probe code retries timed-out version
  probes, but the cause of this observed mismatch has not been proven.
- `tests/check-agent-tooling.test.ts`: readiness changed from expected present
  to partial in some scenarios, and several child processes hit their existing
  15-second or 30-second deadlines.

Canonical failed run:
`.ai/harness/runs/run-20260913T114957-69096-20260913-1143-release-0191-current.json`.
Captured completed-file failure logs and independent review are preserved in
`.ai/harness/runs/release-0191-current-blockers/`. The aggregate diagnostic is
`.ai/harness/runs/verification-vx-84d69d9c43c24f90a726.log`.

No source or test repair was made. Per the AGENTS second-out-of-scope boundary,
the parent requested a scope decision before repairs. No tag, npm publication,
GitHub Release or global runtime refresh occurred. Do not record an
AcceptanceReceipt or finish this contract until valid release evidence exists.

## Approved blocker repairs

The owner approved repairing both observed failure areas and continuing the
0.19.1 publication chain. The original stop is resolved for those two areas.

Oracle root cause: `tests/cli/chatgpt-browser.test.ts:1192` starts the cleanup
budget before Gitleaks and Oracle readiness probes. Instrumented execution
observed 3251 ms in the first Gitleaks process and 5118 ms in actual Oracle
execution (100 ms timeout plus the existing 5000 ms TERM grace), yielding an
8569 ms total against the 8000 ms cleanup assertion. The raw lower-layer
baseline for three fresh executable shell fixtures was 4573/1337/1487 ms on
first exec versus 5/7/15 ms on second exec; `/bin/sh` itself took 5 ms.
The OS-level source of that cold-exec delay is not established. No production
clock, timeout or cleanup defect is inferred from this evidence.

The Oracle assertion will retain its 8000 ms bound but measure from the fake
Oracle's existing argument-file write, which only occurs on its real workload
path after readiness probes. Existing error, staged-egress and descendant
absence assertions remain. Pre-fix instrumentation and failure are preserved
in `/tmp/release-0191-oracle-instrumented.log` and
`/tmp/release-0191-process-timings.jsonl` for the repair run.

CodeGraph root cause was reproduced with four concurrent isolated runs:
codegraph failed in 3/4 lanes and resolver failed in 4/4 lanes. The existing
1-second version probe timed out before a fresh fixture executable reached its
logging statement; its retry explains the extra probe. The test-only fix runs
an unlogged `__fixture-ready` handshake before starting those observations;
the fake timeout wrapper is prepared with `/usr/bin/true`. One shared helper
in `tests/helpers/repo-fixture.ts` bounds this setup to 30 seconds and throws
on failure. The production probe timeout, fixture paths and log assertions
are unchanged.

Repair verification: the three CLI files passed 29 tests / 191 assertions;
four concurrent codegraph runs each passed 3 tests and four resolver runs each
passed 5 tests. `tests/check-agent-tooling.test.ts` passed 32 tests / 287
assertions in 105.49 seconds, covering its prior 12 failing scenarios.
Oracle passed its focused guard with all eight assertions, then passed three
parallel instances alongside the tooling file (a four-file load). The entire
test still includes slow readiness setup, while the unchanged 8-second bound
now belongs to actual Oracle execution and cleanup.

No tests were removed or skipped, no production code was changed, and no
production or existing test deadline was increased. The new shared helper is
used by four existing fixture consumers. The unchanged full release aggregate
remains required before publication; focused passes do not replace it.

## Complete tooling fixture fix

The first repair passed focused checks but its full release retry still hit
15-second tooling test deadlines. The stopped run is
`.ai/harness/runs/run-20260913T122630-42948-20260913-1143-release-0191-current.json`.
A four-process read-only-update reproduction then failed in all four lanes.
Instrumentation showed the remaining fake curl, Herdr, Claude and npm launches
each cost about 2 seconds, in addition to fixture warmup. The issue was the
sum of cold fixture launches, not a production readiness deadline defect.
Adding a warmup for every executable would merely move the same accumulated
cost within the existing test deadline.

The final helper instead prepares one shell launcher per test process and
links each original fixture command path to it. A private non-executable body
beside that path is interpreted by its declared /bin/sh or /bin/bash. The
shell uses exec, retaining the child PID, arguments, environment, working
directory, output and exit status. These four callers do not inspect their
script path. The fixture root and command pathname remain unchanged; bodies
are removed with the existing fixture cleanup, and afterAll removes the shared
launcher. No package/runtime code consumes this test-only helper.

A lower-layer probe measured 4566 ms to prepare the launcher, then 9-16 ms for
four newly-created fixture paths with distinct bodies and correct outputs.
Final four-file parallel coverage passed 61 tests / 478 assertions: tooling
32/287 in 26.89s, CodeGraph 3/20 in 5.21s, resolver 5/91 in 5.98s, and doctor
21/80 in 12.82s. It includes the real hanging-probe timeout mapping and the
same original positive and negative command-log assertions. This replaces the
per-executable warmup implementation from the first repair; no sentinel was
added to the individual fake tools in the final diff.

## Complete gate and approved expanded repair boundary

Frozen run `vx-88142df9a8bf4c73ae25` at `38d80371` completed all test files
and failed seven cases in six files: Fleet retry; MCP fixed Codex goal; two
global runtime cases; lane environment isolation; verification concurrency;
benchmark artifact preparation. Oracle and all four tooling fixture consumers
passed. The owner authorized repairing every release-gate blocker and then
continuing publication, preserving assertions and production deadlines.

## Expanded repair decisions

- P1/P2 lane environment: `check-ci.sh all` exports the expensive-test flag;
  the nested functional-lane fixture inherited it from the outer release run.
  Removing that inherited flag in both child environments preserves the actual
  script as lane authority. `lane-env-red.log` records `PRE_FIX_EXIT=1`;
  `lane-env-green.log` passes both existing tests and all 13 assertions.
- P1/P2 concurrency: the counter preceded a fixed 0.5-second sleep, so a slow
  second CLI could arrive after the first released its lock. Injecting 750 ms
  before that CLI reproduced status 0 instead of waiting. A bounded release-file
  rendezvous now holds the first request through second-request admission; the
  same delayed probe passes all five original assertions. Production locking
  and deadlines are unchanged. The release marker stays outside the subject.
- MCP and global runtime still generated fresh shell executables. Their 5-second
  and 30-second failures match the measured cold-start pressure, although their
  focused pre-fix reruns passed. These causes remain inferred from the canonical
  loaded run, not individually reproduced. They now use the same shell fixture
  helper; the non-shell Node fixture remains direct. Complete files pass 18/197
  and 43 tests respectively. The canonical four-file gate remains decisive.
- Global runtime canonicalizes executable paths. A symlink to the shared launcher
  lost the private body location and reproducibly returned exit 64. Hard links
  retain each fake command path while sharing the prepared inode. All consumers
  create their fixture commands on the same temporary filesystem. No runtime
  consumer or fixture body depends on the generated script path.
- P1/P2 benchmark: the self-contained dependency closure is about 310 MiB,
  including roughly 276 MiB of the native CodeGraph package. Baseline preparation
  took 22.59 s, with final default compression taking 19.60 s. `gzip -1` on the
  same staging tree took 14.70 s. The portable tar compressor option preserves
  gzip format, contents and hash validation while trading a larger temporary
  archive for lower CPU work. Its first test run overlapped the compression
  measurement and still hit 30 s; the subsequent instrumented run passed the
  unchanged artifact/mutation guard in 21.13 s. The real two-install case passed
  in 32.62 s under its unchanged 60-second budget. At 10x package size, compression
  and staging I/O remain the first limits; no dependency is omitted.
- Fleet's one failed retry has not reproduced: one focused run, four concurrent
  focused runs, and two complete-file runs all passed with no source/test change.
  One complete-file run included the release environment. A process trace showed
  healthy retry output and collector-group absence. Do not attribute this to the
  FIFO writer without evidence or describe it as a fixed product defect; retain
  the original assertion and verify it again in the complete release gate.

The bugfix profile requires its exact regression guard as a `package_test`
(H1), even when an aggregate covers it. The captured failing lane guard is
therefore a required two-second preflight; this is the only deliberate overlap
with the release aggregate, not a second full verification authority.

## Final preparation evidence

`run-20260913T132245-32390-20260913-1143-release-0191-current.json` passed all
16 contract criteria at `29245bb6d51be793d7a5221eaaaa396d7f2a563f`. Its release
execution `vx-1d380329781f4342a7b9` passed in 741727 ms. The complete aggregate
includes 447 test files and the real tarball installation smoke. All seven
prior failures passed; saved per-file results are in the ignored `expanded-gate`
subdirectory. The owner then approved the current repairs and release continuation;
the typed disposition is owner acceptance, not a second external review.
No publication or installed-runtime update is claimed by this preparation result.
