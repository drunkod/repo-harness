Canonical and semantic acceptance have not run. This artifact reports candidate evidence only.

## Root cause evidence

The production local collector trusted effective-state's semantic-subject-only acceptance freshness; contract/goal edits could retain a ready Publication. The five real local guards in `tests/unit/merge-readiness-v1-effect.test.ts` first prove ready, then mutate contract, goal, observation existence/bytes or receipt bytes. All five fail on unfixed source with actual true versus expected false; `.ai/harness/runs/akn06-readiness/pre-fix.log` records PRE_FIX_EXIT=1. They pass with the canonical observation binding. The positive lifecycle normalization guard also passes.

## Verification

158 distinct tests across the four contract suites pass. `focused-final.log` holds readiness effect16/core7/Fleet28 passes and the original browser106 passes; its newly added browser test initially had missing test helper/type references. `browser-final.log` records all107 browser tests passing, and `browser-guard-final.log` records the final fully typed guard passing after replacing a partial input cast with the actual card fields. `type-final.log` and `build.log` exit0. The earlier positive fixture failure came from Bun homedir ignoring an in-process HOME mutation; an explicit internal effect seam now keeps all acceptance records in the disposable fixture home.

All logs are under `.ai/harness/runs/akn06-readiness/`. All nine required repository integrity checks pass; results are in `integrity-results.json`. No provider/model call or real acceptance issuance occurred: controlled canonical records seed the regression; production local readers and real Git/Lease paths are exercised. Browser verification here is DOM integration, not a new installed/native journey.

Current CodeGraph proof and independent semantic acceptance remain pending. No stage PR, main merge or runtime installation is claimed.

## Supersession

Superseded by the AKN-05/06 restack integration (`tasks/archive/notes-20260923-1351-akn05-06-restack.md`, PR #447). The per-slice verification and acceptance evidence recorded in this review is bound to pre-restack subjects and does not transfer to the integrated branch. Acceptance for the integrated code is PR #447 CI plus an independent gate.
