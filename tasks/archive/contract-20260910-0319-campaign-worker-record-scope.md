## Why

The generated worker prompt requires writes outside the narrow business allowlist, causing the actual worker to refuse implementation and omit its result record.

## Goal

Keep repository edit scope unchanged while making the exact runner result output obligation explicit and routing out-of-scope Notes observations to the parent.

## Scope

- In scope: generated worker prompt, shipped script mirror, focused model-free tests and workflow evidence.
- Out of scope: grant/cap changes, new provider calls, recovery semantics, context-file repair, verifier authority changes.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

A narrow-scope dry-run still mandates a Notes write outside its writable paths, or campaign output wording grants broader file authority than its exact result path.

## Root Cause Evidence

- root_cause: scripts/contract-run.ts worker prompt requires Notes and result writes while stopping on every path outside business Allowed Paths.
- repro: bun test tests/contract-run.test.ts --test-name-pattern "dry-run writes prompts and manifest"
- regression_guard: tests/contract-run.test.ts
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: tasks/evidence/campaign-worker-record-scope-pre-fix.log

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/archive/plan-20260910-0301-campaign-worker-record-scope.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260910-0319-campaign-worker-record-scope.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/archive/notes-20260910-0319-campaign-worker-record-scope.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

This is the single directly blocking extra after the approved campaign acquisition-cap repair. Actual worker and verifier both exited inactive; no semantic result was invented. Live BRC requires separate reconciliation and new acquisition authority. Verification stays model-free and uses named runner coverage, not a full suite.

## Rollback Point

Revert prompt and matching mirror; do not replay or alter any persisted campaign dispatch.
