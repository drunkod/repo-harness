## Why

The Fleet read model is the Task Board's only view of every registered
repository. Its failure unit was the repository, so a single throwing card
observation replaced every readable row of that repository with an empty
`unreadable` row, and a single sprint-cell edit made the task inbox permanently
unreadable through that same path. An operator watching the board could not
tell the difference between "this repository has no work" and "one receipt is
missing". Cards with no sound column were silently absent from the totals, so
the board's own numbers did not add up to the rows it displayed.

## Goal

Contain Fleet board observation failures at the card boundary: a throwing card
observation yields a typed card error and no classification while its sibling
cards stay readable; unclassified cards are counted; the round deadline can
preempt a synchronous card phase; and the operator write stops holding the
machine-global registry authorization lock across the per-task lock.

## Scope

- In scope: card-level failure containment and card `error`; `counts.unclassified`
  through the core projection, the digest basis, and the operator transport view;
  inbox scans skipping superseded-revision events with `superseded_revision_count`;
  event-loop yields plus deadline preemption bookkeeping; provider limiter slot
  transfer; registry authority realpath comparison; Agent Runtime read folded into
  card consistency; registry/task lock order in the operator write.
- Also in scope, as the two orchestrator-authorized out-of-scope fixes:
  (1) the browser transport decode of the two additive fields in
  `src/operator-web/types.ts` and `src/operator-web/fixture.ts`, because they are
  required members of the type the browser shares and the branch must type-check
  on its own; (2) the `origin_required` error code in `src/operator-web/types.ts`
  and its en/zh copy in `src/operator-web/i18n.ts`, deferred from the #316
  acceptance gate, because the merged server (`src/effects/operator/server.ts`)
  already emits that code and the client decoder rejects it.
- Out of scope: browser board chips, composer copy, and styling for the new
  fields; all client i18n work other than the `origin_required` copy above;
  deriving the claim-scope canonical fence from the lease record;
  `task_label` null versus empty-cell ambiguity; R1 delivery/reachability
  contributing to `attention_owner`.
- Taste constraints: keep the public repository/card error vocabulary closed and
  message-normalized; never invent field values for a failed observation.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

If containing a card failure hid a genuinely unreadable repository — that is, if
a repository whose registry, authority, sprint, or board resolution failed still
reported `status: 'ok'` — this direction would be wrong. The cheapest proof is
`tests/effects/fleet-board.test.ts`, which still requires a repository-level
throw to produce `status: 'unreadable'` with no cards while a card-level throw
produces `status: 'ok'` with a typed card error.

## Root Cause Evidence

- card containment pre-fix artifact: `.ai/harness/runs/pre-fix-fleet-board-card-containment.log`
  captures the same work package's first defect, where `src/effects/fleet/board.ts:307-314`
  let `collectBounded` rethrow the first card observation error out of
  `collectRepository` and `collectFleetBoard` mapped it to a repository-level
  `repositoryError`, so one missing publication receipt produced `status: 'unreadable'`
  with `cards: []` for the whole repository.
- root_cause: `src/effects/fleet/task-message-request.ts` released the registry
  authorization lock after resolving the repository and then re-checked that authority
  with an unlocked read at the top of the task-lock section, so a `read_only` revocation
  committing between that re-check and `writeImmutableEvent` was never observed and the
  operator send returned `created: true` against a repository that was already read only.
- repro: `bun test --timeout 60000 tests/effects/operator-task-message.test.ts` on the
  unfixed source; the guard pauses the sender's canonical `git show` only while the task
  lock is held, commits a `read_only` revocation, releases the barrier, and observes
  `{ ok: true, created: true }` instead of `repository_read_only`.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: a card whose own observation throws carries a typed
  `error`, has `column: null`, and leaves its sibling cards readable; the
  repository stays `status: 'ok'` and `snapshot_consistency: 'degraded'`.
  `counts.unclassified` reports every card with no sound column. An inbox scan
  skips superseded-revision events and reports `superseded_revision_count`; a
  caller naming one exact event and revision still fails closed. The operator
  write nests the two locks task-outer, registry-inner. One short registry-lock
  critical section runs before the task lock and does nothing but resolve the
  repository from the strict registry snapshot: registered, `read_write`, and
  its canonical path. A second registry-lock critical section runs inside the
  task lock and re-proves that same registration, `access_mode`, and path
  before performing `writeImmutableEvent`. There is no registry-revision fence:
  neither `registryRevision` nor `authorizationRevision` is read, and equality
  of the resolved path under the lock is the whole proof.
- Edge cases: round preemption is never contained at the card boundary, so a
  deadline or abort still fails the whole repository; a repository that returned
  its observation before the round aborted keeps its result even if the round
  clock has since passed the deadline; a registered path under a symlinked
  ancestor or with a trailing separator is valid authority while a symlinked leaf
  is still rejected.
- Regression risks: the operator write now takes the task lock outside the
  registry lock, so the registry lock is held only for the two short critical
  sections above. That nesting is one-directional:
  `withRepoHarnessRegistryAuthorizationLock` has one product caller, nothing
  `src/effects/repo-registry.ts` runs under that lock acquires a task lock, and
  its only caller-supplied hook writes a config file, so no cycle exists. Three
  existing assertions changed meaning: a revocation that lands while a
  publication waits for the task lock now wins, a blocked canonical read no
  longer pins the machine-global registry lock, and the browser decoder now
  requires `counts.unclassified` and a nullable card `error` in the payload it
  accepts.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: `1a9a5ae1` (branch base on `main`)
- Revert strategy: revert the branch's commits together — the fleet board, task
  inbox, task message request, and transport projection changes plus their
  tests; no persisted artifact format changes, so no data migration.
