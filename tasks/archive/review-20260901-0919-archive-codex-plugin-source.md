## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: classifier/template, focused tests, workflow closeout artifacts, and provider-owned architecture manifest.
- Actual files changed: 18 tracked files; review subject contains 6 semantic paths.
- Commands passed: full Bun suite, required repository checks, strict contract verification, sealed-terminal WP2 verification, and final sprint acceptance.
- Residual risks: the semantic review budget allows no second provider pass; the owner's typed waiver closes the corrected exact subject.
- Reviewer action required: merge the accepted PR.
- Rollback: revert the single implementation commit and restore the archived WP2 family from that commit.

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: parent-agent bugfix workflow plus official Codex plugin semantic review.
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: policy authority in `scripts/acceptance-receipt.ts`; sealed-terminal flow in `scripts/classify-historical-plans.ts`; archive consumer in `scripts/archive-workflow.sh`.
- Root cause or plan evidence: `DEBUG.md` and the tracked pre-fix failure artifact.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: protocol-2 `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance` passed.
- Commands run: 3646 tests passed with 2 platform skips; all root required checks passed.
- Manual checks: exact archived WP2 classifier command returned the sealed terminal triple.
- Supporting artifacts: `DEBUG.md`, pre-fix failure log, checks projection, and archived WP2 family.
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes.
- Run snapshot: `.ai/harness/runs/run-20260901T054810-94553-20260901-0432-archive-codex-plugin-source.json`.

- Summary: Owner approved this work package; the external P2 finding was addressed and the one-review budget is exhausted.
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Receipt classification now derives the expected source from the frozen contract policy instead of hard-coding either host route.
- `codex-review` and `codex-plugin` each pass only under their matching protocol-2 policy; invalid policy, mismatches, and forbidden waivers fail closed.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- The first external review found the global-literal replacement flaw. That finding was fixed, but the one-review budget intentionally prevented a provider retry; owner acceptance is recorded as `user_waiver`, not external pass.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 10/10 | Both host policy routes and mismatch cases are covered. |
| Product depth | 9/10 | The fix closes WP2 archival without changing provider execution. |
| Design quality | 10/10 | One existing policy authority, no compatibility alias. |
| Code quality | 10/10 | Runtime/template parity and full suite verified. |

## Failing Items

- None.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun test tests/historical-plan-classifier.test.ts tests/archive-evidence-gates.test.ts`.
- Re-check: the exact sealed-terminal command from the task contract.

## Summary

- Accepted through the owner's typed waiver after correcting the sole P2 external finding and exhausting the work-package semantic review budget.
