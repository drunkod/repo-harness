## Why

Content matching currently admits active work without exact-revision evidence. A blanket refusal on the shared proof would also strand historical final settlement and cleanup.

## Goal

Refuse every new active campaign admission and new child launch before side effects while preserving strictly proven historical final settlement, retirement and cleanup. Keep BRC6a and BRC14 pending until a trusted revision producer exists.

## Scope

- In scope: the approved plan, active adoption/replay, planning/admission, Fleet offer/acquire readiness, handoff/new launch, and the distinction between historical proof and current admission; typed historical fixtures and named regressions.
- Out of scope: provider integration, canary, budget arithmetic, broad Lease changes, publication/release, closing the BRC6a Sprint row.
- Do not add receipt schemas without a producer, product bypasses or guard mocks.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

The fix is wrong if an old challenge receipt permits new Task/Lease/child work, if shadow observation stops working, or if an exact already persisted final cannot settle/clean up without spawning.

## Root Cause Evidence

- root_cause: src/core/automation/connector-challenge.ts verifies echoed SHA and sampled content only, but src/effects/automation/issue-batch-adoption.ts accepts it on both active new and replay publication paths; historical manifests remain executable through current offer/admission consumers.

- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260907-1806-brc6a-admission.md`

- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

No local full-suite criterion: named suites cover the admission and historical lifecycle crossing. Required remote CI retains its full checks. Freeze implementation before final prepare; original broad passes remain baseline only.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- No new dependency or public configuration.
- The new admission module is shared by the observed active mutation/readiness consumers; it does not duplicate stored proof.
- Historical fixture construction is explicitly synthetic and cannot count as trusted producer evidence.
- BRC6a exact-revision producer and BRC14 remain pending.

The 24/24 prepared run run-20260907T175053-7442 is baseline evidence for 77375559 and its recorded worktree snapshot. A subsequent test-only correction makes the two final-tamper records structurally valid so they exercise budget semantic validation instead of the earlier journal-format refusal. The new final-tamper-delta runs the complete worker suite. Product code, other tests and toolchain are unchanged. The named baseline executions remain historical evidence, never a claim that their complete suites ran on the final test revision; current type and integrity checks run again. Plan trailing whitespace and generated manifest provenance are non-behavioral changes.

## Rollback Point

- Baseline: 8cf2af5b87e712a946449e6604feea3c67dbfe75.
- Revert only this bounded package after owner decision; no data migration or automatic fallback.
