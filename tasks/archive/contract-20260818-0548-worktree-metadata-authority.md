## Why

The base-staleness guard shipped in `6ad02039` is the authority that decides which commit every scope gate diffs from. A reproduced bypass lets a stale base through silently while the resolver uses it, and a missing optional dependency removes the guard entirely. A scope authority that can be silently absent is worse than none, because the passing gate is read as evidence.

## Goal

One typed selector chooses exactly one metadata record; the resolver and the guard consume that same record; every state that is neither "no matching metadata" nor "verified current" fails closed with a distinct cause.

- In scope: `scripts/verify-sprint.sh` and its byte-identical mirror `assets/templates/helpers/verify-sprint.sh`; the existing base-guard test file.
- Out of scope: `contract-worktree start` behaviour, splitting `base_commit` into scope-origin and integration-base fields, `base_epoch`, automatic metadata refresh, any network access from `verify-sprint`.
- Taste constraints: agreement between guard and resolver must hold by construction, not by comment. The previous comment asserted an invariant the code did not hold. <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

If failing closed on these states blocked ordinary work rather than catching real ambiguity, the direction would be wrong. Cheapest proof point: after the change, this repo's own three live contract worktrees must still pass their gates unchanged.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: `contract_worktree_metadata_rows` in `scripts/verify-sprint.sh` skipped a row only when it serialized to the empty string, but an all-empty matching record joins to two separators, so the guard's `head -1` consumed it and returned silently while the resolver skipped it and used the next row's stale base.
- repro: two metadata files in one fixture -- an exact-worktree match with every field empty, and a branch match carrying a pre-rebase base -- then run `bash scripts/verify-sprint.sh`; the guard prints nothing while `contract_worktree_base_commit` returns the stale SHA.

- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260818-0509-worktree-metadata-authority.review.md`

- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.
