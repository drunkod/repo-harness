## Design Decisions

- Split parallel ownership by write boundary: the parent owns shared Operator
  server/worker cancellation paths; workers own Task Inbox staging, Fleet/UI
  projection and recovery, and workflow/collaboration checks respectively.
- Each Task Message runs in its own child process. Request timeout, disconnect,
  and server shutdown send TERM, escalate to KILL after a bounded grace, wait
  for process death, and then allow only dead-PID lock reclamation.
- Fleet collection runs in an independent collector child. On Windows an
  out-of-Job controller creates the inert collector, assigns its exact
  `Process.Handle` to an unnamed Job with `KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` before forwarding
  a start payload, and acknowledges
  cancellation only after `ActiveProcesses == 0`; POSIX uses a detached process
  group with bounded TERM-to-KILL escalation and an absence check.
- Consistency severity is monotonic from child card to repository to Fleet, and
  browser transport validation enforces the same cross-field invariants.
- The diff-aware workflow gate hashes the final contents of substantive paths and
  admits only an exact digest line in a changed canonical artifact or a validated,
  scoped machine-readable waiver. General documentation stays non-substantive,
  while architecture and legacy progress documents remain gated.
- The temporary Git index is seeded from `HEAD`, updated from the complete
  worktree, and filtered to substantive paths only when producing the canonical
  raw diff. This keeps committed base-only deletions representable without
  letting workflow artifacts enter the substantive identity.
- Task-sync fixture processes remove ambient CI diff-selection variables before
  applying each test's explicit environment, so the host PR base cannot become
  an invalid authority inside an independently initialized fixture repository.

## Deviations From Plan Or Spec

- None recorded.

## Tradeoffs Considered

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Worker-thread Task Message cancellation | Rejected | Worker threads share the parent PID, so liveness cannot prove the cancelled execution no longer owns a lock. |
| Windows `taskkill /T` Fleet cleanup | Rejected | A bare PID is reusable and `taskkill` success does not prove the exact provider tree is empty; the Job handle is the lifecycle authority. |
| Ignore all temporary-looking files in canonical scans | Rejected | It would turn unknown bytes into an implicit compatibility path. |
| Patch only production collectors | Rejected | Pure projection and decoder boundaries must protect every caller and payload. |

## Open Questions

- None.

## Verification Results

- Final `bun test --timeout 60000`: pass in 1,174,283ms through strict contract verification.
- Issue-focused combined suite: 377 pass, 0 fail across 13 files.
- `bun run check:type`, `bun run build:operator-web`, `bun run check:helpers`, and
  `git diff --check`: pass.
- Root workflow, architecture, deploy SQL, project-state inspection, and init
  dry-run checks: pass after final evidence binding.
- ArchContext accepted the collaboration consistency-fence delta as
  `changeset.docs-projection-4121ba806cbbf60a`; the receipt is bound to signal
  `sha256:32e5ab0843e7c014ed5018af18601c4ee5f4e8beb6fb013dabf6680442a4533d`
  and approval event `orchestrator-plan-20260901-1119-close-265-review-gaps`.
- The first read-only gate rejected the earlier Windows PID-tree cleanup. After
  replacing it with exact-handle Job ownership and making diff evidence stable
  across dirty/staged/committed lifecycles, the final read-only gate passed all
  ten issue contracts.
- PR #277's first CI run exposed two host-only test assumptions: CRLF-sensitive
  source assertions on Windows and inherited PR diff-selection variables inside
  task-sync fixtures. Both were corrected at the test/identity ownership
  boundaries, and a committed-deletion base-range regression was added.
- The first Windows runtime smoke then proved the controller failed before its
  request loop because PowerShell attempted to cast static C# method descriptors
  into asynchronous process delegates. The C# boundary now owns event wiring
  directly, avoiding both the invalid bootstrap cast and a PowerShell runspace
  callback dependency; timeout failures also report controller stderr.
- The next Windows runtime readback exposed a native layout bug: the projected
  `JOBOBJECT_BASIC_ACCOUNTING_INFORMATION` omitted `TotalPageFaultCount`, so
  `ActiveProcesses` read the preceding counter and could never prove the Job was
  empty. The managed struct now matches the Win32 field order before emitting
  `cleanup_ack`.
- Windows runner cold-start compilation of the controller's embedded C# can
  exceed five seconds. The runtime smoke now uses a bounded 15-second
  per-response deadline with stage-specific errors; product cleanup deadlines
  remain unchanged.

## Promotion Filter

Promote a candidate to `tasks/lessons.md`, `docs/researches/`, or harness asset files only when all three hold: hard to reverse, surprising without local context, and a real trade-off existed. If any one is missing, keep it in this notes file instead.
