## Why

The real BRC15a run created ten Issues but admitted none; prompt and verification projections omitted the contracts consumed by adoption.

## Goal

Make authoring convey the existing metadata and exact capability authority; refuse incomplete snapshot policies before any provider launch; correct model verification projection only where exact provider evidence proves it.

## Scope

- In scope: approved bounded authoring/adoption alignment, deterministic regressions, native integrity checks and durable evidence.
- Out of scope: live GPT, grant minting, old receipt rewrite, active campaign, release and unrelated main WIP.
- Taste constraints: <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

A prompt built from dirty capability bytes, a missing registry admitting provider I/O, or issue-number selection passing startup would falsify the correction; the focused tests exercise these cases.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: gpt-pro-issue-authoring.ts buildIssueAuthoringPrompt omits metadata types and exact capability vocabulary; development-campaign-policy.ts admits issue-number selection that the full snapshot reader rejects.
- repro: bun test tests/effects/gpt-pro-issue-authoring.test.ts tests/unit/development-campaign-policy.test.ts
- regression_guard: tests/effects/gpt-pro-issue-authoring.test.ts

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/archive/plan-20260908-0143-brc15a-adoption-alignment.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260908-0205-brc15a-adoption-alignment.md`

- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Exit Criteria (Machine Verifiable)

This block contains only non-executable artifact requirements. Define every
executable check once in the canonical Verification Plan below. Each check must
state its phase, cost, evidence policy, necessity, and input environment; a
missing or malformed plan fails closed.

```yaml
exit_criteria:
  files_exist:
    - docs/researches/20260908-brc15a-adoption-alignment.md
  artifacts_exist:
    - .ai/harness/checks/latest.json
    - tasks/archive/notes-20260908-0205-brc15a-adoption-alignment.md

```

This is the sole executable verification authority. Use `baseline_with_delta`
only when a referenced immutable baseline plus named current delta checks prove
the intended coverage; do not infer that choice from paths or command text.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: metadata constraints and frozen capability IDs reach initial and continuation prompts; startup rejects incomplete issue-number snapshots.
- Edge cases: dirty current registry is ignored; missing frozen registry refuses before intent and provider I/O.
- Baseline: run-20260908T015705-80673 passed 22/22; only the CLI startup fixture changes afterward, verified by campaign-cli-delta. The original evidence is baseline, not an exact pass for the new subject.
- Regression risks: Oracle effort authority remains absent, so model verification remains false and BRC15a is pending. No provider call or old receipt mutation.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: main 33c5012e1185a695fdaf54a7bb84fc613cfb653b.
- Revert strategy: revert only the bounded alignment commit; preserve the independent canary and Oracle packages.
