## Human Review Card

- Verdict: accepted through the single Codex plugin review against policy origin/main, with zero findings.
- Scope: registered-repository historical activity GET, original TaskInbox/ClaimActor provenance, bounded worker lifecycle and strict browser transport. UI presentation remains a downstream slice.
- User-visible behavior: exact stored messages remain inspectable after current Task, Lease and Binding authority changes.
- Rollback: remove the GET and historical readers together, preserving all stored message and reply records.

## Mode Evidence

P1: Operator registry/HTTP boundary, canonical TaskInbox records, immutable ClaimActor store and browser decoder. P2: exact repository/task/message input flows through bounded historical parsing and original-chain validation to an allowlisted response. P3: history records observations independently of live execution authority; hard budgets expose incomplete coverage and hold admission until the worker exits.

## Verification Evidence

Frozen source192c2a764ca51cc78804c1c7b45c9f5bb9e3af00 passed24/24 criteria in `.ai/harness/runs/run-20260922T162242-47860-20260922-0418-akn04-activity.json`. The canonical Verification Plan executed19 checks, including browser decoder, typecheck, browser bundle, owning effects/server tests and all repository integrity checks. CodeGraph sync and deterministic projection required no human action or refresh signal.

The single independent review approved exactly subject8fc98afbd604512d8457eea1e203b2bc86f9c711181bb6c67fd960ea1cbb752f against origin/main0d4371c3, with no findings. Its disposable environment passed101 focused tests but could not load the browser decoder suite because React was absent. That environment limitation is retained; the same decoder suite executed successfully in the canonical dependency-provisioned checkout before review. Acceptance finalization reused the prepared evidence without rerunning tests.

## Integration corrections

Accepted placement9394f197 carries protected replies, the encoded-record bound and the verified Windows fixture correction. After integration, the historical reader still referenced the retired local record constant. The existing activity suite failed before the one-call-site correction and passed11 tests/62 assertions afterward; `.ai/harness/runs/akn04-activity/upstream-limit-before.log` retains PRE_FIX_EXIT=1. The reader now consumes the canonical core limit without a fallback or duplicate authority.

The existing empty-body regression also remains covered: historical transport preserves valid empty TaskReply bodies rather than applying nonempty metadata rules. Durable behavior and limits are documented in `docs/researches/20260922-operator-task-activity.md`.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

List discovery stops at hard budgets; exact known-message access is the recovery path. Cross-store observations are not atomic snapshots. Local acceptance does not prove installed/native Host behavior or the full Steer journey. Hosted CI is tracked against the published PR head separately.
