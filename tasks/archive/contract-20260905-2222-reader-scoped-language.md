## Why

Shipped templates, skills, and hook advisories mix Chinese and English by accident, and no datum decides which language human-facing documents use. Downstream repos inherit that drift on every init. If skipped, every generated repo keeps bilingual headers that tests and hooks parse literally, and agents keep guessing document language per session.

## Goal

Agent-facing shipped surfaces are English-only, and human-facing document language is a single repo-level datum `.ai/harness/policy.json#documentation.language` (enum `en | zh-CN | follow-user`, default `en`) chosen at init, referenced (not copied) by the generated root context and document-generation rules. Follow `plans/archive/plan-20260905-1421-reader-scoped-language.md` Captured Planning Output for exact file targets.

## Scope

- In scope: Phase 1 (delete six orphan Chinese templates and the metro advisory; English headers in design-brief template and its helper mirror; English-only hook advisory strings; English obsidian-memory skill body; `geju` term; reference-config mirror sync; coupled tests). Phase 2 (policy `documentation.language` with fail-closed validation via env `REPO_HARNESS_DOCUMENTATION_LANGUAGE`; init question renamed `Human-facing language` driving both the global reporting instruction and the repo datum; root-context and document-generation rules; completion-summary label rendered per reporting preset; coupled tests and snapshots).
- Out of scope: this repository's README; zh-TW or other enum values; a `--language` CLI flag; runtime language detection; hook intent regexes, skill trigger phrases in `description`/`when_to_use`, and `src/operator-web/i18n.ts`.
- Taste constraints: <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

What observable evidence would prove this task's direction wrong, and the cheapest proof point to check first. Leave as-is if not applicable.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/archive/plan-20260905-1421-reader-scoped-language.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260905-2222-reader-scoped-language.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/archive/notes-20260905-2222-reader-scoped-language.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.
