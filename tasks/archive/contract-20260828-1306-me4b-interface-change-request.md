## Why

Cross-capability interface decisions currently exist only as untrusted message/prose. If the slice ships with a second Work Package authority, self-asserted actor identity or implicit message/code transitions, it can bypass delivered ME-1A scheduling, Binding fencing and Human acceptance boundaries.

## Goal

Deliver a closed ME-4B request/event/current authority with source Engineer, target Engineer and Human actor separation; immutable accepted Work Package projections; exact current canonical-target Sprint/Work Graph materialization proof through the complete ME-1A projection; separate implementation/integration evidence; deterministic reverse lookup; and no direct mutation of planning, Task, Lease, Publication, Acceptance or architecture-event authority. Engineer mutations are limited to the Human-approved authenticated MCP verbs `propose|submit|cancel|materialize|implemented`; Human alone owns `accept|reject|integrated`.

## Scope

- In scope: ME-4B core schemas and transition matrix; git-common immutable store and per-request CAS; exact current Binding validation; exact Git Work Graph materialization verification; restricted authenticated Engineer MCP surface; Human-only CLI transition and read surface; focused tests; ArchContext capability/module projection; PRD/research/workflow closeout.
- Out of scope: direct Sprint/Work Graph/code mutation; modifying ME-1A Work Package wire bytes; Provider runtime, daemon, generic Worker Host; ME-2B writable grants; Task/Lease/Publication/Acceptance transitions; architecture-event mutation; parsing message body as authority.
- Taste constraints: closed exact-key records, one datum/one authority, fail closed on missing/stale bytes, no compatibility fallback or generic state/payload extension; authorization IDs are lookup carriers only and never semantic identity or CLI payload.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

The direction is wrong if an accepted projection cannot be verified against the existing `projectWorkGraph` result without modifying `WorkPackageDefinitionV1`. Cheapest proof: build one exact Sprint/Work Graph fixture, accept a projection, and prove materialization by the existing scheduler before adding CLI or architecture surfaces.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260826-1617-me4b-interface-change-request.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260826-1617-me4b-interface-change-request.review.md`

- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: closed actor-fenced lifecycle and exact tracked materialization.
- Edge cases: stale concurrent transitions, crash after immutable event, mismatched Binding/capability/commit/work graph, repeated idempotency key with changed bytes.
- Regression risks: accidental ME-1A wire change or a second planning authority; both are explicit negative-test and review gates.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: exact final ME-4B subject recorded by verify-sprint.
- Revert strategy: revert the core/store/CLI/tests/capability projection and scheduling validator export as one unit; leave immutable git-common evidence unread.
