## Why

PR #265 passed remote CI but left ten reproduced correctness gaps across cancellation,
durability, consistency projection, browser authority validation, collaboration
fencing, and workflow evidence. If skipped, an aborted write can poison future
operations, stale or impossible observations can remain actionable, and CI can
continue accepting substantive changes with no evidence bound to the change.

## Goal

Close all ten audit findings at baseline `1ead6cea` with fail-closed behavior,
focused regression coverage, canonical workflow evidence, and the repository's
full required checks passing.

## Scope

- In scope: Task Message request/worker cancellation and deadlines; Task Inbox
  staging; Fleet provider process supervision; card/repository/Fleet consistency;
  browser stale-draft recovery, success-envelope decoding, and cross-field
  invariants; collaboration-mode fencing; diff-aware workflow-evidence gating.
- Out of scope: new product features, GitHub Issue writes, protocol aliases,
  compatibility fallbacks, and unrelated UI redesign.
- Taste constraints: preserve one authority per datum and reject invalid or stale
  states instead of synthesizing compatibility behavior.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

The direction is wrong if cooperative worker cancellation cannot release owned
resources within a bounded grace period, or if the existing workflow artifacts
cannot bind evidence to a deterministic diff identity. The cheapest proof is a
focused worker-cancellation test plus helper-script fixtures before full-suite work.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/archive/plan-20260901-1119-close-265-review-gaps.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260904-1852-close-265-review-gaps.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/archive/notes-20260904-1852-close-265-review-gaps.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: every audit acceptance criterion is represented by source
  behavior and a focused regression test.
- Edge cases: timeout, client disconnect, shutdown, worker hard-stop escalation,
  torn observations, malformed 2xx acknowledgments, and diff exceptions.
- Regression risks: shared Operator server lifecycle and workflow CI classification;
  full-suite and dry-run initialization are mandatory.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: `9cd82901` before implementation.
- Revert strategy: revert the single work-package merge unit, including workflow
  artifacts, source, tests, and check wiring.
