# CI job split decisions

- Keep the no-argument script as the complete local/release gate; hosted jobs select governance or functional explicitly. This avoids duplicating the command inventory.
- Both jobs resolve diff-base because functional regression fixtures exercise workflow checks; Governance performs hygiene, while Test retains pinned Herdr and package smoke. MCP path matrix remains independent.
- Branch protection live-readback requires only `Required / CI`; no settings change is needed.
- Pre-fix regression on 3a30bd89: 0 pass, 4 fail; governance exit 19 prevented the functional sentinel. Post-fix development run: 23 pass across four focused files. Final acceptance remains subject-bound through verify-sprint.

## Acceptance blockers

- Focused verification: 24 passing tests across the four named CI test files; typecheck and all six root integrity commands passed in the isolated worktree.
- First prepare-acceptance failed before freeze with CodeGraph unavailable and archctx human-action-required / verified-flow-proof-changed. Initialized the existing repository's CodeGraph setup in this new worktree (1,105 files).
- Second prepare-acceptance failed after provider apply: added ignored `.archcontext/generated/ARCHITECTURE.md` changed the observed worktreeDigest, so the harness rejected the provider result. The provider also modified `docs/architecture/.projection-manifest.json`; that generated diff remains uncommitted and is not part of CI implementation scope. Local log: `/tmp/ci-job-split-acceptance.log`.
- Stop boundary reached: second out-of-scope fault; no acceptance receipt, commit, PR or merge has been performed. Preserve the generated state for diagnosis; do not absorb it into the CI slice or bypass the projection gate.

## Approved blocker resolution

- User approved resolving the projection generated-file/snapshot boundary. Provider source trace confirms archctx 0.5.8 ChangeSetEngine unconditionally rebuilds `.archcontext/generated` after explicit docs operations. Both harness and provider intentionally include that directory in their input digest; do not weaken either fence.
- Upstream fix is isolated in `arch-context-wt-projection-declared-writes`; no runtime pin or release is included in the CI slice. The provider-generated manifest is an automatic acceptance artifact and is now explicitly scoped here.
- CI branch fast-forwarded to origin/main d48d2eee (#377) before final verification; previous local checks remain development evidence only.
