## Why

Archived workflow artifacts currently retain live Plan/Contract/Review/Notes
pointers after those files move. Rewriting those pointers naively changes the
contract and goal fingerprints bound by an existing AcceptanceReceipt, so a
closed workflow cannot be re-verified after a legitimate target rebase.

## Goal

Archive one workflow family with resolvable internal pointers while preserving
the exact pre-archive AcceptanceReceipt contract and goal identities. The
projection must be explicit, versioned, deterministic, transactional, and
fail closed when malformed.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - Add a strict archive path-projection envelope owned by `archive-workflow.sh`.
  - Bind the projection manifest and exact archived artifact bytes in a host-owned
    ArchiveProjectionReceipt chained to the semantic AcceptanceReceipt.
  - Rewrite exact live workflow paths to their precomputed archive destinations
    in plan, contract, review, notes, and archived todo bodies.
  - Reverse-normalize only a valid declared projection before AcceptanceReceipt
    contract/goal hashing.
  - Preserve receipt verification for historical strict envelopes that predate
    the projection field.
  - Add focused archive and receipt identity regression tests and close the
    deferred Todo.
- Out of scope:
  - Broad migration of all historical archives, heuristic slug/path lookup,
    automatic acceptance, provider action, or changes to implementation-subject
    path classification.
  - The architecture-projection acceptance implementation and the separate R1
    worktree.
- Taste constraints: one writer and one identity normalizer; invalid projection
  syntax or cross-family mappings fail closed instead of being inferred.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

If an exact pointer rewrite cannot reproduce the pre-archive contract and goal
fingerprints without ignoring unrelated Markdown, the projection envelope is
insufficient. The cheapest proof is an acceptance fixture that records a receipt,
archives and rewrites the family, then verifies the same receipt byte-for-byte.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260831-0345-archive-acceptance-authority.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260831-0345-archive-acceptance-authority.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/20260831-0345-archive-acceptance-authority.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: archived internal workflow pointers resolve to files in
  the same archive family; AcceptanceReceipt preserves pre-archive authority.
- Edge cases: collision-suffixed destinations, absent optional artifacts,
  malformed/duplicate projection lines, and historical envelopes without a map.
- Regression risks: archive prediction manifests and packaged helper parity must
  remain byte-consistent.
