## Why

`obsidian-memory` currently declares two hard companion Skills in its own body,
but the catalog and installer do not model or install them. A profile install can
therefore report success while the first explicit memory operation fails. The
catalog must become the single dependency authority without making vault access
or third-party downloads part of the default workflow.

## Goal

Register pinned, integrity-checked `obsidian-markdown` and `obsidian-cli`
external packages; model `obsidian-memory`'s dependency closure; and install or
refresh that exact bundle only when `repo-harness install|update
--with-obsidian-skills` is explicitly supplied. Preserve optional `brainRoot`,
non-vault hooks/CI, and the existing atomic global-runtime transaction.

## Scope

- In scope: manifest provenance/integrity entries and dependency edges; catalog
  dependency validation/closure selection; install/update CLI opt-in; external
  Skill projection/receipt/rollback; tooling readiness projection; focused
  tests and install-profile documentation; plus the user-approved, test-only
  removal of the stale per-test timeout that blocked the required full suite.
  The separately approved closeout slice also resizes the fixed verifier and
  outer helper budgets to contain the measured required suite, without adding
  a per-invocation override, and commits the contract authority before binding
  canonical evidence.
  The subsequently approved gate slice replaces adapter-parity's five stale
  per-test 30-second overrides with one file-level budget sized from measured
  loaded execution; production Effective State and lock behavior stay out of
  scope.
- Out of scope: vendoring upstream Skill bodies; installing or launching the
  `obsidian` executable or desktop App; npm runtime dependencies; vault
  discovery; hook/CI/workflow vault access; `brain sync` behavior.
- Taste constraints: one catalog dependency authority; no duplicate Obsidian
  Skill constant, compatibility parser, semantic fallback, or silent download.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.
- Stop if the existing external-Skill transaction cannot verify and project two
  subpaths from one immutable provider without weakening per-Skill full-tree
  integrity.

The user explicitly approved the bounded closeout-journal timeout unblocker on
2026-08-21. It may change only the regression guard's timeout ownership, not
the production closeout implementation or semantics.

## Falsifier

The direction is wrong if the current external-Skill transaction cannot express
two independently integrity-bound subpaths from one pinned provider. Cheapest
proof: pin the provider, compute both subtree hashes, and exercise the existing
fetch/verify path before broad installer changes.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: explicit opt-in installs/updates exactly the two pinned
  companion Skills for requested hosts; ordinary install/update does not fetch
  them.
- Edge cases: dependency graph rejects unknown, self, duplicate, cyclic, and
  host-incompatible edges; managed drift fails atomically after opt-in.
- Regression risks: default profile installs, global-runtime rollback, and
  optional no-`brainRoot` operation must stay unchanged.
