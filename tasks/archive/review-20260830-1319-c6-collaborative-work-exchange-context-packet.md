- Summary: C6 collaborative Work Exchange and context delivery accepted after two external review rounds. The exchange snapshot unifies offers, threads, signals, handoffs and opportunities, carrying existing EngineerOfferV1 records through byte-identically with offer_revision untouched against scheduler-produced fixtures. Round one's two P1s are closed. Consistency is now derived from two full passes over every source rather than per-source sequential double-reads, so the observation windows overlap pairwise and a write landing between two sources can no longer yield a combination that never coexisted while still being labelled stable; the claim is calibrated honestly, with the docstring stating that stable asserts pairwise overlap rather than atomicity and naming the absence of a cross-store lock as the residual, and the regression test was proven real by a temporary revert-to-sequential canary. The raw handoffs field is removed from the returned collection, so unverified bound_task execution_context is no longer exposed at the API surface; snapshot.open_handoffs is the verified projection with its key set pinned, and a forged claim_id is absent from the full serialization. Context packets render inside the untrusted wrapper and bind to dispatched goals through CollaborationRunContextBinding, with only a stable collection deliverable. The dispatch fence implements four refusal modes and is deliberately unwired with zero production callers, recorded plainly in the ledger with a bolded forward constraint that C7 must call it before dispatchDelegatedRun; ledger claims about which refusal modes are honest-path, forged-state-only or recorder-prevented are now accurate. C0's frozen inventory and digest are untouched, no delivery-plane source is modified, the delegated_worker adoption refusal is retained with the Host as adopting actor, C5's deferred succession entrypoints are absorbed, and the scale benchmark is ledgered as a triggered deferral.
