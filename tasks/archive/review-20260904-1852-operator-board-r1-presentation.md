## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass
- Change type: frontend
- Intended files changed: Operator browser presentation, focused browser tests, design brief, and this work-package's workflow artifacts.
- Actual files changed: `src/operator-web/{App.tsx,fixture.ts,i18n.ts,styles.css}`, `tests/operator-web/{operator-ui.test.tsx,operator-interactions.test.tsx}`, `docs/design/DESIGN-local-human-control-board-v1.md`, and the plan/contract/review/notes/todo workflow surfaces.
- Commands passed: focused 56-test suite, `bun run check:type`, `bun run build:operator-web`, full `bun test --timeout 60000`, and all repository Required Checks.
- Residual risks: responsive correctness is guarded by layout classes, scroll-lock behavior, and live asset smoke rather than a committed visual screenshot; no persistence or authority path changed.
- Reviewer action required: none after the typed AcceptanceReceipt projects a passing disposition.
- Rollback: revert the single browser/read-projection work-package commit.

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: approved work-package in an isolated contract worktree.
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: recorded in `tasks/archive/notes-20260904-1852-operator-board-r1-presentation.md`; the server DTO remains authoritative, the browser validates and renders it literally, and runtime evidence remains presentation-only.
- Root cause or plan evidence: source validation already accepted protocol 3; the stale ignored build and hard-coded footer created contradictory presentation. Rebuilding through the package authority and rendering the payload protocol removes the contradiction without a fallback.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: repository-equivalent focused and full verification completed; final typed acceptance remains the machine closeout authority.
- Commands run: `bun test tests/unit/operator-fleet-snapshot.test.ts tests/operator-web/operator-ui.test.tsx tests/operator-web/operator-interactions.test.tsx tests/cli/operator-serve.test.ts --timeout 60000`; `bun run check:type`; `bun run build:operator-web`; `bun test --timeout 60000`; all commands from root `AGENTS.md` Required Checks.
- Manual checks: launched `bun src/cli/index.ts operator serve --port 4319`, confirmed `/api/v1/fleet/snapshot` protocol 3, and confirmed served assets contain R1 exception and recipient-mode copy.
- Supporting artifacts: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json` and `.ai/harness/runs/`.
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes.
- Run snapshot: populated by final `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`.

- Summary: 用户已明确批准执行该 Operator Board R1 UI/UX work-package。
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- The first non-empty worklist group opens by default; empty and later groups remain collapsed.
- Runtime unavailability and failed/reconciliation delivery render as secondary exception badges, while grouping remains bound to the authoritative Task projection.
- The drawer renders exact `runtime_reachability`, `delivery_state`, `effect_sha256`, and `failure_class` evidence.
- Message copy distinguishes the current owner from the next claimant, and protocol 2 remains rejected.
- Narrow layouts use an opaque modal drawer, body scroll isolation, and 44px minimum interactive targets.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- No blocking residual risk. A future browser-visual regression harness could add screenshot evidence, but it is not needed to establish this slice's state, identity, or authority invariants.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 10/10 | Protocol 3, R1 evidence, grouping, copy, and modal behavior are covered and pass. |
| Product depth | 9/10 | R1 evidence is visible at the correct secondary layer without expanding workflow authority. |
| Design quality | 9/10 | Existing visual language is preserved while mobile isolation and touch sizing are corrected. |
| Code quality | 9/10 | The implementation reuses the accepted DTO and existing components; no compatibility parser or shadow state was added. |

## Failing Items

- None.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: focused tests, typecheck, browser build, full suite, then root Required Checks.
- Re-check: serve the source CLI and inspect the protocol-3 snapshot plus the selected Task's delivery/runtime evidence.

## Summary

- PASS. The UI now projects protocol-3/R1 facts truthfully and improves worklist/mobile usability while preserving the five-column authority boundary and fail-closed behavior.
