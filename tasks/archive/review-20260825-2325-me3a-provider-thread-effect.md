## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: ME-3A schemas/store/CLI/MCP/tests/ArchContext/workflow artifacts plus ME-1C idempotent delivery observation
- Actual files changed: closed Provider Thread schemas; git-common-dir journal/current projection; local operator commands; restricted read-only Engineer MCP; architecture capability/flow and exact inventory tests
- Commands passed: typecheck; focused behavior/CLI/MCP gates; MCP HTTP 15/15; full repository suite 3097 pass / 2 platform skips / 0 fail; architecture sync with dead_letters=0 and blocking=0
- Residual risks: a crash after `effect_started` persistence but before host receipt can require manual observation; this deliberately sacrifices liveness to preserve zero duplicate Provider turn
- Reviewer action required: none
- Rollback: revert the single ME-3A publication commit; the new git-common-dir namespace does not rewrite existing Task/Lease/Fleet authorities

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: parent-agent implementation and deterministic acceptance
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: captured plan and implementation notes; ME-1C remains message authority, Provider transport remains host-owned, and ME-3A owns only immutable intent/action admission/observation
- Root cause or plan evidence: plan falsifier and lost-ACK fixture prove a started effect never emits a second host action

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: equivalent strict repository gate set passed; exact-subject Human waiver was projected
- Commands run: contract exit criteria plus `bun test --timeout 60000`
- Manual checks: reviewed persist-before-action ordering, pending-at-start revalidation, exact Codex turn correlation, Binding/capability fences, idempotent delivery projection and forbidden runtime surfaces
- Supporting artifacts: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`, architecture projection manifest, ME-3A unit/CLI/MCP tests and Runtime Admission Canary references in the PRD/research
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes
- Run snapshot: full suite 3097 pass / 2 skip / 0 fail

- Summary: User approved the bounded ME-3A Codex-first control-plane adapter and architecture acceptance.
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- One persisted pending ME-1C event can now become one immutable effect intent and at most one host-executed Codex action.
- Lost acknowledgement and unknown outcomes enter reconcile-only state; no CLI, MCP or store path retries the Provider action.
- Exact positive Provider correlation idempotently records ME-1C delivery while Task, Lease, Fleet and Acceptance bytes remain unchanged.
- Restricted Engineer MCP adds only capability/status reads; mutation remains local operator authority.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- The at-most-once boundary is intentionally availability-conservative: an action possibly lost before host execution is not automatically retried.
- Linear per-Engineer effect listing is the first expected 10x pressure point; no secondary index or daemon is justified before measurement.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 10/10 | One-action admission, restart/lost-ACK reconcile and delivery projection pass. |
| Product depth | 9/10 | Complete ME-3A bridge; delegated runs and lifecycle automation remain explicitly separate. |
| Design quality | 10/10 | Host runtime authority and control-plane evidence authority remain disjoint. |
| Code quality | 10/10 | Closed schemas, canonical digests, fault injection, exact inventories and full verification. |

## Failing Items

- None.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun test --timeout 60000`
- Re-check: `repo-harness run verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, typed waiver receipt, then `repo-harness run verify-sprint`

## Summary

- ME-3A is accepted and published inside the approved Codex-first control-plane boundary.
