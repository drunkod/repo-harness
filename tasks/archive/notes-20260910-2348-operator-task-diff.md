# Task diff merge decisions

Configured external filters are refused instead of silently disabling transformations; fsmonitor is disabled for every new-reader Git invocation. This preserves explicit comparison semantics.

Root Cause Evidence:
- root_cause: `task-diff.ts` disabled external diff/textconv but native Git still invokes clean/process filters and fsmonitor.
- repro: real Git configured filter writes `filter-ran` during the GET read.
- regression_guard: `tests/effects/operator-task-diff.test.ts`, configured clean/process case.
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: `/tmp/operator-diff-filters-prefix.log`, PRE_FIX_EXIT=1; returned untracked paths included `filter-ran`.

Git-emitted paths are canonicalized before comparing with Node realpaths. The focused real-Git effect test is added to the existing Windows/macOS/Linux matrix, retaining all ownership checks.

The first prepare-acceptance run lacked the isolated worktree's CodeGraph index. The existing required CodeGraph setup initialized/synced that index; deterministic projection then retained the same model and flow-proof digests and updated only generated provenance. The proof-only refresh signal is reconciled through the official command, not accepted as a semantic architecture change. The first official plugin invocation was rejected as stale_scope while generated provenance changed; it is not acceptance evidence. Final review runs only after the corrected subject and workflow authority are committed.

Root Cause Evidence (Git observation cascade):
- root_cause: diff lazily fetched missing promisor blobs and omitted assume-unchanged tracked entries.
- repro: real Git missing blob invoked configured upload-pack marker; assume-unchanged edit returned an empty patch.
- regression_guard: effect tests cover both states and the production worker missing a canonical sprint blob; worker environment disables lazy fetch for inherited authority readers too.
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: `/tmp/operator-diff-cascade-prefix.log`, PRE_FIX_EXIT=1 for both reported cases; `/tmp/operator-diff-cascade-all.log` passes 12 real Git tests with 47 assertions.

CI fixtures isolate system/global Git config. The hosted runners configure Git LFS globally; the intentional filter refusal was reached before unrelated test assertions. Product behavior still refuses configured external transformations, including unused commands. No host/global configuration was changed.

Windows CI exposed pre-existing directory-fsync EPERM in the lease writer used during fixture setup, before any diff read. Reader fixtures now seed canonical serialized lease bytes using the existing path functions on every platform; no write-durability implementation or expectation is changed.

Semantic acceptance remains blocked: `/tmp/operator-diff-plugin-review.json` is stale_scope and `/tmp/operator-diff-plugin-final.json` is review_budget_exhausted. The existing one-attempt circuit policy was preserved. All 11 declared verification commands passed at run-20260910T231010-87128. An explicit owner waiver is still required; merge authorization is not a waiver.

Owner explicitly approved the typed user waiver and continuation. Windows diagnostics were used only to prove the refusal point and removed before final acceptance.

Integrated origin/main a8b56203 (PR #396) before final acceptance; App/i18n merged cleanly and the generated projection is regenerated from the new base.

Root Cause Evidence (Windows binding):
- root_cause: Node realpath retains RUNNER~1 while Git reports runneradmin; string equality rejected two names for the same physical directory.
- repro: Windows CI run 34497113070, `/tmp/operator-diff-win-binding.log` line 346 records the short owner/realpath and long Git topology/common directory; valid reads then fail unavailable.
- regression_guard: existing real Git reader cases in the Windows/macOS/Linux matrix retain valid binding, foreign worktree rejection and prunable sibling coverage.
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: `/tmp/operator-diff-win-binding.log` (9 failing reader tests).

The reader compares directory device/inode identities (requiring directories and nonzero IDs) for Git common-dir, topology and top-level; it still requires the stored owner path to equal its own realpath and preserves all claim/task/branch fences. This handles multiple path spellings without interpreting them as separate repositories. The helper has three consumers protecting the same physical-directory invariant; no dependency is added.
