## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: ME-1B schema/projection/CLI/tests, ArchContext projection, PRD and workflow evidence
- Actual files changed: closed overlay/attention schemas; strict Profile/Binding/Claim/message/Provider projection; `sprint graph` and `engineer board`; focused and inventory fixtures; architecture/workstream artifacts
- Commands passed: typecheck; focused behavior/CLI gates; architecture inventory gates; full repository suite 3104 pass / 2 platform skips / 0 fail; all root required checks
- Residual risks: collection is sequential and performs two reads per component; at 10x scale local I/O latency fails before schema correctness
- Reviewer action required: none
- Rollback: revert the single ME-1B publication commit; the feature is read-only and introduced no mutable authority store

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: parent-agent implementation and deterministic acceptance
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: captured plan and implementation notes; Planning, Fleet, Engineering and Organization views remain independent authorities/read models
- Root cause or plan evidence: the plan falsifier proves Binding/runtime-only changes do not alter Fleet bytes and a mid-read generation change cannot be labeled stable

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: equivalent strict repository gate set passed; exact-subject Human waiver was projected
- Commands run: contract exit criteria, root required checks and `bun test --timeout 60000`
- Manual checks: reviewed exact-key validation, strict registry authority, component support/consistency joins, owner attribution and absence of mutation/provider routes
- Supporting artifacts: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`, architecture projection manifest, focused ME-1B tests and full-suite log
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes
- Run snapshot: full suite 3104 pass / 2 skip / 0 fail across 252 files

- Summary: User approved the bounded ME-1B engineering overlay and continuous implementation through ME-2B.
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Planning Graph and Fleet Board preserve their existing schemas and authorities.
- Engineering Overlay projects Profile/Binding/Claim/message/Provider observations with exact per-component digests and two-read consistency.
- Organization Attention contains only closed, owner-attributed reasons; later delegation and memory protocols remain explicit `unsupported`.
- Read-side projection performs no repair, Provider action, Task/Lease transition, Publication or Acceptance mutation.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Sequential double reads are intentionally the smallest coherent local projection. If measured latency exceeds the budget at higher Engineer counts, bounded parallel collection can preserve the same component fences without changing authority.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 10/10 | Three independent read commands and consistency/failure paths pass. |
| Product depth | 9/10 | Complete minimal control board; web presentation remains deliberately outside P0. |
| Design quality | 10/10 | No second Fleet/runtime authority and every observation carries an exact owner revision. |
| Code quality | 10/10 | Closed schemas, canonical digests, strict authority reads, fault/performance fixtures and full verification. |

## Failing Items

- None.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun test --timeout 60000`
- Re-check: `repo-harness run verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, typed waiver receipt, then `repo-harness run verify-sprint`

## Summary

- ME-1B is accepted and canonically published inside the approved read-only control-plane boundary.
