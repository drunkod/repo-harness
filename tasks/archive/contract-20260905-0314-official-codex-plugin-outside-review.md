## Why

Codex-host outside review currently launches Claude as the reviewer. The official OpenAI Claude Code Codex plugin now exposes a Codex app-server review runtime, so leaving the old path in place misstates the reviewer boundary and keeps deprecated Claude-specific prompt, retry, and transcript-recovery machinery alive. A partial migration would be worse: it could issue an acceptance receipt whose reviewer/source does not match the process that actually reviewed the subject.

## Goal

On Codex hosts, route repo-harness outside review through the enabled official `codex@openai-codex` plugin and record `reviewer=Codex, source=codex-plugin`. Preserve the existing pinned combined subject, one-review budget, typed P1/P2 findings, and fail-closed evidence binding. Keep Claude-host outside review on the existing direct Codex provider.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - Replace the runnable `claude` provider with a `codex-plugin` provider backed by the official plugin companion/app-server runtime.
  - Validate official plugin inventory, enabled state, install-path containment, command result, and structured findings before accepting output.
  - Special-case Codex-host skill selection, installation/readiness checks, contract policy projection, hook guidance, and acceptance receipts.
  - Preserve historical protocol-1 Claude receipts as readable evidence while preventing them from selecting a runnable provider.
- Out of scope:
  - plugin Review Gate, rescue/transfer commands, Claude-host direct Codex review, merge-gate receipts, and unrelated provider/model routing.
- Taste constraints: <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.
- Stop rather than falling back to Claude or direct Codex when the official plugin is missing, disabled, unsafe, or returns malformed output on a Codex host.

## Falsifier

The direction is wrong if Claude Code's public plugin inventory cannot yield a safely-contained enabled official install path, or if one official app-server review cannot inspect the pinned base plus staged, unstaged, and untracked paths. The cheapest proof is the adapter contract test followed by one live exact-branch plugin smoke.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/archive/plan-20260825-1234-official-codex-plugin-outside-review.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260905-0314-official-codex-plugin-outside-review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/archive/notes-20260905-0314-official-codex-plugin-outside-review.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: Codex host selects the official plugin provider; Claude host selects direct Codex; both return the existing typed result shape.
- Edge cases: missing/disabled/multiple/unsafe plugin installs, non-zero app-server exit, malformed JSON, invalid severity/path/line fields, and subject drift all fail closed.
- Regression risks: plugin CLI inventory or output-schema drift; host detection ambiguity; template/source mirror drift; historical receipt rejection.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: worktree branch `codex/official-codex-plugin-outside-review` before any `codex-plugin` receipt is published.
- Revert strategy: revert the provider, host projection, acceptance-policy protocol, and templates together; no persisted product data migration is required.
