## Why

Fresh audit and group sequencing are missing after accepted BRC integration; generic transitions and repeated initial baselines cannot satisfy the Sprint.

## Goal

Implement complete group snapshot, budgeted fresh audit observation, shared-store acceptance gates and ordered group baseline consumption; preserve current unavailable exact-version boundary.

## Scope

- In scope: core/effect audit and group projection, audit budget operation, campaign CLI/store/authoring callers, focused tests and integration-base artifacts; user-authorized observer selection-policy and campaign-step capability-registry fixture alignment.
- Out of scope: GPT calls, BRC6a probes, main WIP, global install/release and fake trusted revision authority.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

Missing revision authority, stale or reused sessions, incomplete slot coverage, wrong SHA, skipping groups or a naked accept_group must never advance the campaign.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear as a `package_test` check in Verification Plan).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/archive/plan-20260908-0418-brc14-fresh-audit-runtime.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260908-0515-brc14-fresh-audit-runtime.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/archive/notes-20260908-0515-brc14-fresh-audit-runtime.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.
