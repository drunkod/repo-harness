## Design Decisions

- Keep repository edit authority unchanged; authorize only the current campaign output file and return out-of-scope Notes observations to the parent.

## Deviations From Plan Or Spec

- Acceptance first observed a proof-only architecture candidate because the isolated worktree had no CodeGraph index. Canonical tools ensure initialized/synced the index; projection updated its manifest, and architecture-projection reconcile produced an empty noop with ready proof. No model or semantic approval was changed. Evidence: /tmp/worker-record-architecture-reconcile-final.json.

## Tradeoffs Considered

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Explicit output obligation | Use | Avoid an expanded business allowlist and a parallel scope parser. |

## Open Questions

- None.

## Evidence Links

- Checks: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`

## Promotion Filter

Promote a candidate to `tasks/lessons.md`, `docs/researches/`, or harness asset files only when all three hold: hard to reverse, surprising without local context, and a real trade-off existed. If any one is missing, keep it in this notes file instead.

## Promotion Candidates

- Promote to `tasks/lessons.md` only after a repeated correction or failure pattern.
- Promote to `docs/researches/` only when it is durable repo knowledge with evidence.
- Promote to harness asset files only after verification across more than one task or fixture.
