## Why

BRC10 must recover campaign ownership without confusing child exit or elapsed TTL with provider termination. The actual invocation boundary and existing journal/Lease stores must join before a reclaimed Task can reuse its worktree.

## Goal

Deliver typed Codex campaign execution, persisted invocation termination, dispatch retirement fencing, evidence-gated Lease reclaim and exact original-worktree recovery, with no duplicate child or second owner.

## Scope

- In scope: actual Codex transport in contract-run, tracked role configuration, invocation evidence, supervisor streams, campaign retirement and reclaim journal, existing Fleet/Engineer rebind primitives, affected regressions and final evidence.
- Out of scope: a new scheduler/service/store root, implicit widening of read-only delegation, automatic PR merge inside campaigns, BRC13/14 product changes, token hard-limit claims.
- Taste constraints: <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

A typed provider terminal detached from the actual executable/argv/output or a second child after a persisted launch invalidates the direction. Prove the real-process transport and crash fences before enabling reclaim.

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/archive/plan-20260907-0554-brc10-lifecycle.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260907-1214-brc10-lifecycle.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/archive/notes-20260907-1214-brc10-lifecycle.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Exit Criteria (Machine Verifiable)

This block contains only non-executable artifact requirements. Define every
executable check once in the canonical Verification Plan below. Each check must
state its phase, cost, evidence policy, necessity, and input environment; a
missing or malformed plan fails closed.

```yaml
exit_criteria:
  files_exist:
    - docs/spec.md
  artifacts_exist:
    - .ai/harness/checks/latest.json
    - tasks/archive/notes-20260907-1214-brc10-lifecycle.md

This is the sole executable verification authority. Use `baseline_with_delta`
only when a referenced immutable baseline plus named current delta checks prove
the intended coverage; do not infer that choice from paths or command text.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: all 12 executable criteria passed at 16aaf754 in run-20260907T114556-51253. Overall prepare failed because the Change Assessment oracle declaration was absent, not because a behavior check failed. The declaration now points to the existing recovery matrix. The subsequent parser and detached-command inactivity correction retains the immutable recovery/affected baseline and executes current unit, collector, typed-process, type and integrity checks; it does not claim that the new tree ran the old broad suite.
- Edge cases: active/unknown provider, unconfirmed group, changed generation, publication protection and crash windows must preserve ownership.
- Regression risks: Existing raw-command runs retain their behavior but cannot supply positive provider terminal evidence. No local full suite is required; named affected tests cover this boundary and PR/main CI supplies the full gate.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: main a3fb4db2; isolated codex/brc10-recovery.
- Revert strategy: Revert source changes and stop new managed invocation/reclaim; retain all immutable journals and existing worktrees. No external state rollback is inferred.
