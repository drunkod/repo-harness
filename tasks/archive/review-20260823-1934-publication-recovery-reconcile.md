## Human Review Card

- Verdict: PASS
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: publication lifecycle/reconcile core and effects, publication CLI, board/mutation guidance, focused tests, and workflow artifacts listed by the contract.
- Actual files changed: 16 files across commits `9028f759` through `f56137a5`, all inside Allowed Paths.
- Commands passed: focused WP0-C 10/10; contract 24/24; full suite 2857 pass, 2 platform skips, 0 fail; typecheck and all root required checks.
- Residual risks: Task Inbox, readiness offer/acquire, and MCP mirror remain outside WP0-C.
- Reviewer action required: none; the user explicitly supplied the exact-subject waiver required by Acceptance Policy.
- Rollback: revert WP0-C as one unit; WP0-A receipts and WP0-B reviewing leases remain readable and operator-actionable.

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: user-approved work-package with architecture review, implementation worker, independent gatekeeper, and explicit user-waiver closeout.
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: captured plan and implementation notes; gate traced provider observation, isolated fetch, merge classification, task-lock revalidation, evidence persistence, and exact lease removal.
- Root cause or plan evidence: approved PRD v3 WP0-C and the contract's provider-OID and merge-classifier falsifiers.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: independent gatekeeper PASS after the missing task-revision race fence was corrected and re-reviewed.
- Commands run: all 24 contract Exit Criteria; full suite result `2857 pass / 2 skip / 0 fail`.
- Manual checks: `COORDINATION_PROTOCOL` unchanged; `current_publication` remains the sole mutable authority; integration evidence is written before exact lease removal.
- Supporting artifacts: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json` and `.ai/harness/checks/change-assessment.latest.json`.
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes.
- Run snapshot: `.ai/harness/runs/run-20260822T215721-97970-20260822-1915-publication-recovery-reconcile.json`.

- Summary: User explicitly approved user waiver for workflow closeout in this task thread.
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Reconcile fetches the provider target into an isolated observation ref, classifies the exact fetched OID through the existing merge helper, and proves canonical `[x]` at that commit.
- The task lock revalidates receipt, pointer, claim, generation, head, task revision, and provider base before evidence-first exact lease removal.
- Recovery exposes explicit inspect/reconcile/confirmed-abort adapters over the existing closeout journal rather than creating a second recovery authority.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- WP1 readiness and offer/acquire semantics remain the next PRD dependency; WP0-C intentionally adds no daemon, session-liveness, or feedback inbox behavior.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 10/10 | Recovery, provider-fetched reconcile, negative fences, and exact closeout verified. |
| Product depth | 9/10 | Complete WP0-C boundary; later readiness and inbox work remains explicitly separate. |
| Design quality | 10/10 | One mutable publication authority; existing merge classifier reused; evidence is immutable. |
| Code quality | 9/10 | Focused and full suites pass; concurrency regression covers fetch-to-lock revision change. |

## Failing Items

- None.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: contract Exit Criteria followed by `repo-harness run verify-sprint`.
- Re-check: exact AcceptanceReceipt subject, target, contract, goal, and verification bindings after any semantic edit.

## Summary

- PASS. WP0-C is fully verified, the user-waiver AcceptanceReceipt is valid, and no blocking findings remain.
