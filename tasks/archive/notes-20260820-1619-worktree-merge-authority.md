## Design Decisions

- The batch-path regression guard lands as two cases, not one. The positive
  case (`ship-worktrees --cleanup-merged` must clean a squash-merged worktree)
  is the issue #196 reproduction. The negative control (a branch carrying one
  commit main does not have must still print `Skipped unmerged branch:`) is the
  contract's falsifier applied at the batch entrypoint, and it is what keeps a
  future "fix" from widening the check into a deleter. The negative control
  already passes pre-fix, which is the point: it proves the positive case fails
  for the stated reason and not because the fixture is broken.
- Both new cases run non-dry-run. `run_cmd` in `scripts/ship-worktrees.sh:105`
  only echoes under `--dry-run`, so a dry-run assertion would test the echoed
  command string rather than the removal, and would not have caught the
  deletion half of the bug.

- The lib lives at `scripts/worktree-merge-lib.sh`, not `scripts/lib/`.
  `scripts/lib/` is the "internal, deliberately not projected downstream"
  tier: `helpers.scripts` carries 54 entries with zero path separators,
  `scripts/lib/project-init-lib.sh` is absent from it, and the packaged
  runtime directory is `package:assets/templates/helpers`. This lib must be
  projected -- the installed `contract-worktree.sh` sources it -- so it belongs
  to the packaged tier by definition. The flat-inventory assertion at
  `tests/helper-scripts.test.ts:580-583` was left alone: it guards projection
  completeness, and editing it would have been making room for a
  misclassification.
- Both consumers fail closed when the lib is absent (`worktree merge library
  is unavailable`, exit 1) rather than falling back to the old inline
  ancestry check. A fallback would have quietly restored the exact two-authority
  split this contract exists to remove.
- `scripts/ship-worktrees.sh:1138` enumerates the accepting modes
  (`ancestor` or `absorbed`) instead of negating `unmerged`. An earlier
  revision negated, on the stated reasoning that an unrecognized mode would
  fall to the safe side. That reasoning was backwards and review caught it:
  negation routes every unrecognized value into the *accepting* branch.
  What is actually at risk there is not deletion -- ship has no deletion site
  of its own and delegates all removal to `contract-worktree.sh cleanup`,
  whose enumerated `case` (`scripts/contract-worktree.sh:1804-1815`) exits 1
  on anything outside `ancestor|absorbed`, so worktree, branch, and metadata
  all survive. The irreversible write sits *before* that delegation:
  `guard_dirty_merged_worktree` at `:1146` runs ahead of the delegation at
  `:1148`, and under `--discard-scaffold-only` it reaches
  `discard_scaffold_dirty_paths` (`:787-819`), which runs `git checkout --`
  over tracked scaffold and `rm -f` over untracked files. Reviewer reproduced
  it: with a genuinely unmerged branch and an injected `rebased` mode,
  uncommitted `tasks/todos.md` was reverted and untracked
  `plans/plan-draft.md` was deleted, and only then did the tool announce that
  the branch was unmerged and refuse cleanup. The work was already gone.
  Enumeration puts unknown values on the refusing side, which is where they
  belong.
- The enumeration is written as two `==` comparisons, not `@(ancestor|absorbed)`.
  `scripts/ship-worktrees.sh` never runs `shopt -s extglob`, so the extglob
  form silently fails to match and breaks the negative control.

## Falsifier Verification

Ran by hand against `worktree_merge_mode` in a throwaway repo (source the lib,
build each shape, print the mode):

| Case | Expected | Observed |
|------|----------|----------|
| A squash-absorbed branch | `absorbed` | `absorbed` |
| B squash tree + one extra commit main lacks | `unmerged` | `unmerged` |
| C plain `--no-ff` merged branch | `ancestor` | `ancestor` |
| D divergent branch conflicting on README | `unmerged` | `unmerged` |
| E nonexistent target ref | `unmerged` | `unmerged` |

Case B is the contract's falsifier and it holds: extraction relocated the
determination without widening it. Case A's ancestry check was confirmed to
answer "no" in the same run, so `absorbed` really did come from the merge-tree
predicate and not from ancestry.

## Deviations From Plan Or Spec

- Execution first stopped at the contract's Stop Condition (two required paths
  were outside `allowed_paths`); the parent adjudicated both, widened
  `allowed_paths`, moved the pre-fix artifact to `tasks/notes/`, and directed
  the flat lib placement. Implementation landed on that amended contract.
- Four test fixtures needed the new lib added to their helper copy lists
  (`tests/contract-worktree-closeout-journal.test.ts`,
  `tests/contract-worktree-single-publication.test.ts`,
  `tests/archive-evidence-gates.test.ts`,
  `tests/continuation-conformance.test.ts`). They enumerate the helpers each
  scenario installs, and the lib is now a hard load-time dependency of
  `contract-worktree.sh` and `ship-worktrees.sh`. This was not foreseen in the
  plan; 26 tests failed on the first full run for exactly this reason.
- One closeout-journal case sourced `contract-worktree.sh` through
  `bash -c "$predicate" complete-effect "$dir"`, so `$0` was the label
  `complete-effect` and `helper_dir` resolved to the repo root instead of
  `scripts/`. The fixture now passes `scripts/contract-worktree.sh` as `$0`.
  The predicate reads `$1` before `set -- help`, so nothing else shifted.
  Worth naming: `helper_dir` was already wrong in that call, but nothing
  consumed it there until the lib made it load-bearing.

## Tradeoffs Considered

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Land the lib and regenerate `assets/templates/helpers/` anyway | Rejected | `assets/` is absent from this contract's `allowed_paths`, and `scripts/verify-contract.sh` / `scripts/contract-worktree.sh:429` enforce that list on the changed-path set |
| Put the lib flat at `scripts/worktree-merge-lib.sh` to fit the packaged helper inventory | Deferred to the parent | Contradicts the contract's mandated `scripts/lib/worktree-merge-lib.sh` path, and still requires the `assets/workflow-contract.v1.json` inventory entry |
| Ship the RED guard alone and hand back | Chosen for round 1 | The guard is fully inside `allowed_paths`, the pre-fix artifact the gate requires must be captured before the fix anyway, and the remaining decision is a packaging-surface call |
| Relax the lib when the file is missing instead of failing closed | Rejected | Restores the two-authority split silently, which is the bug |
| Rewrite `tests/helper-scripts.test.ts:580-583` to tolerate a `lib/` subdirectory | Rejected by the parent | The assertion protects projection completeness; the misclassified path was the thing to move |

## Open Questions

- None open. The two blockers below were adjudicated by the parent and are
  retained as the record of why the contract was amended mid-execution:
  1. `assets/templates/helpers/{contract-worktree,ship-worktrees}.sh` is a
     deterministic projection of `scripts/`. Any edit to either script trips
     `bun run check:helpers` (`[helpers] content drift: ...`), which
     `tests/helper-scripts.test.ts:568` asserts must exit 0 -- and that test is
     a named Exit Criterion of this contract. The two 20260731 predecessor
     contracts both listed `assets/templates/helpers/contract-worktree.sh` in
     `allowed_paths`; this contract omits `assets/` entirely.
  2. A new shared bash lib only reaches downstream repos if it is listed in
     `assets/workflow-contract.v1.json#helpers.scripts` (mirrored in
     `.ai/harness/workflow-contract.json`), because
     `scripts/sync-helper-sources.ts` projects the inventory and nothing else,
     and the packaged helper runtime dir is `package:assets/templates/helpers`.
     `tests/helper-scripts.test.ts:580-583` compares a **flat, non-recursive**
     `readdirSync` of that directory against the inventory, so a `lib/`
     subdirectory cannot be represented without rewriting that assertion.
  Blocker 2 was a judgment call, not a mechanical one: it turns the plan's
  claimed "+1 internal entity, public surface delta +0" into a change to the
  versioned workflow-contract manifest that downstream repos consume. The
  parent resolved it as a reclassification rather than a surface addition --
  the lib is packaged because its consumers are packaged -- and the plan's
  entity-delta line was updated accordingly.

## Evidence Links

- Checks: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`

## Promotion Filter

Promote a candidate to `tasks/lessons.md`, `docs/researches/`, or harness asset files only when all three hold: hard to reverse, surprising without local context, and a real trade-off existed. If any one is missing, keep it in this notes file instead.

## Promotion Candidates

- Promote to `tasks/lessons.md` only after a repeated correction or failure pattern.
- Promote to `docs/researches/` only when it is durable repo knowledge with evidence.
- Promote to harness asset files only after verification across more than one task or fixture.
