## Why

The Windows installer and README advertise a native entrypoint, but every protected helper resolves `/bin/bash` before dispatch. That blocks acceptance, merge, contract-worktree, and ship authority on Windows; trusting caller `PATH` as a quick repair would instead weaken the protected execution boundary.

## Goal

Install one explicit host-owned Git-for-Windows runtime contract and make all four protected helpers consume it with the same fail-closed source, binary, environment, and process-supervision guarantees as macOS/Linux.

## Scope

- In scope: protected-helper platform runtime resolution; install/update contract projection; sanitized Windows child PATH/TMP; trusted Windows process-tree termination; protected TS-helper Git pinning; packaged mirrors; Windows CI smoke; docs.
- Out of scope: installing Git/jq/gh/WSL/Cygwin/MSYS2; PowerShell/TypeScript rewrites of shell helpers; caller-PATH runtime fallback; unrelated issue allegations.
- Taste constraints: one strict protocol-1 host contract; Git/Bash/POSIX tools must bind to one Git-for-Windows root; runtime relocation fails closed with an update instruction.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

A GitHub `windows-latest` runner with its standard Git for Windows installation cannot execute the four protected helper smoke commands after install-time contract projection, or the runtime can be redirected by caller `PATH`/binary overrides. The cheapest proof is the focused Windows matrix test.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: `src/cli/runtime/helper-runner.ts:28-33,391-402` pins protected dispatch to POSIX-only `/bin/bash` and `/usr/bin|/bin/git`, builds a colon-delimited Unix PATH/TMP contract, and provides no Windows host authority for the Git-for-Windows POSIX toolchain.
- repro: on Windows run `repo-harness run contract-worktree status`; protected resolution throws `required system executable is unavailable: bash` before the packaged helper starts.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: native Windows protected dispatch is installed explicitly and consumes only pinned Git-for-Windows/system tool paths.
- Edge cases: absent/malformed/stale/cross-root/symlinked contract, caller env injection, path delimiter, native temp, process-supervisor taskkill lookup.
- Regression risks: POSIX protected-helper authority must remain unchanged; source/template helper mirrors must remain exact.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: contract branch publication commit.
- Revert strategy: revert runtime-contract, installer, runner/supervisor, helper mirror, CI, tests, and docs together; the added host config field becomes inert.
