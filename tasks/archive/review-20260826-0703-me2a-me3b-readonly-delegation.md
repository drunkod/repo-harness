## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: ME-2A/conditional ME-3B schemas, read-only effect/store/CLI, focused tests, PRDs, research and ArchContext projections
- Actual files changed: closed logical Role Profile and capability receipts; immutable admission/intent/launch/observation/result evidence; one-shot Codex read-only action; bounded CLI; delegated-runs capability model and exact inventory tests
- Commands passed: focused delegation 11/11; architecture inventory 7/7; installed-copy 13/13; system-Python runtime smoke 14/14; typecheck; deploy SQL, architecture, task, strict workflow, project-state and init dry-run gates
- Residual risks: read-only only; lost ACK after launch remains conservatively `reconciliation_required`; Codex subprocess startup and protected-path hashing are the first 10x pressure points
- Reviewer action required: none
- Rollback: revert the single ME-2A/ME-3B publication; immutable evidence has no authority mutation edge and no daemon remains

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: approved contract-worktree implementation with Codex acceptance
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: captured plan and implementation notes; existing Task/Lease/WorkEnvelope/Binding/ClaimActorReceipt stay authoritative, one concrete admit-to-observe trace is proven, and the one-shot Provider effect is the smallest boundary that enforces read-only behavior
- Root cause or plan evidence: the native child falsifier wrote its sentinel; the admitted Codex capability canary denied both exact sentinels and preserved byte-identical protected snapshots

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: final gatekeeper returned PASS; strict repository gates passed
- Commands run: contract exit criteria, `bun run check:type`, focused suites, `bun test --timeout 60000`, required architecture/task/state/init checks
- Manual checks: verified exact Host executable/version/argv/profile fences, two-sentinel denial set, at-most-once launch, no process retry after lost ACK, no native `agent_type` claim, and no authority mutation/cancel/fallback/writable surface
- Supporting artifacts: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`, architecture projection manifest, focused unit/CLI tests, implementation notes and organization research
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes
- Run snapshot: final full run reached 3,122 pass / 2 platform skips; its sole failure was the Host Homebrew `python3` sandbox startup timeout, and the exact runtime-smoke file passed 14/14 with `/usr/bin/python3`

- Summary: PASS: exact read-only delegation admission and one-shot Codex host effect preserve authority boundaries, at-most-once launch, lost-ACK reconciliation, and untrusted results.
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Logical Role Profile bytes are tracked and frozen but never presented as Provider-native `agent_type` identity.
- Admission joins exact parent Task/Lease/WorkEnvelope, Engineer Binding, ClaimActorReceipt, Role Profile and Host capability evidence before immutable intent publication.
- Dispatch persists a launch claim before one Host action; observation and collection never retry the action and WorkerResult stays untrusted.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Native child read-only admission remains rejected until Provider-issued effective sandbox evidence exists.
- The read-only path intentionally has no cancellation surface; unknown launch outcome requires reconciliation, not guessed-session control.
- ME-2B writable delegation remains a separate later acceptance boundary.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 10/10 | Exact admit/dispatch/observe/collect and crash/lost-ACK paths pass. |
| Product depth | 9/10 | Complete read-only P0; writable and verifier trust remain intentionally separate. |
| Design quality | 10/10 | One-shot effect preserves Provider and control-plane authority boundaries. |
| Code quality | 10/10 | Closed schemas, canonical bytes, symlink-safe persistence and focused fault tests. |

## Failing Items

- None.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun test tests/unit/me2a-me3b-readonly-delegation.test.ts tests/cli/delegation.test.ts --timeout 60000`
- Re-check: `repo-harness run verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, typed protocol-2 receipt, then `repo-harness run verify-sprint`

## Summary

- ME-2A and conditional ME-3B are accepted and published as the read-only delegation boundary.
