## Why

Later real campaign Task attempts currently reserve dispatch for both children, so the existing repair-cycle limit is never consumed.

## Goal

Reserve the complete worker/verifier attempt before its first child, charging one repair cycle for later attempts and settling only after both children and the final result are verified.

## Scope

- In scope: paired worker/verifier reservation in the existing budget algebra, selected from canonical attempt_count; real multi-attempt regression and budget refusal; one directly blocking characterization correction for approved Sprint insertions versus the immutable historical migration receipt.
- Out of scope: new budget authority or policy defaults, automatic retry loop, campaign-wide transient policy, adoption sequencing, BRC10, whole BRC9 acceptance.
- Taste constraints: <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

A later real worker consumes zero repair cycles, its verifier charges a second repair, or exhaustion permits a child invocation.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear as a `package_test` check in Verification Plan).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Exit Criteria (Machine Verifiable)

This block contains only non-executable artifact requirements. Define every
executable check once in the canonical Verification Plan below. Each check must
state its phase, cost, evidence policy, necessity, and input environment; a
missing or malformed plan fails closed.

```yaml
exit_criteria:
  files_exist:
    - docs/spec.md
  artifacts_exist:
    - .ai/harness/checks/latest.json
    - tasks/archive/notes-20260907-0423-brc9-repair-accounting.md

This is the sole executable verification authority. Use `baseline_with_delta`
only when a referenced immutable baseline plus named current delta checks prove
the intended coverage; do not infer that choice from paths or command text.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: the first child of a later actual attempt consumes one repair cycle through the existing budget operation; its verifier does not consume another.
- Edge cases: exact replay, retry policy backoff and non-retryable outcomes, repair exhaustion before child effects.
- Regression risks: shared worker and acquisition authority. Named tests cover this delta; no local full-suite trigger.
