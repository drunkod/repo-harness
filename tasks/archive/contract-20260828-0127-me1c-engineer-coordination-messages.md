## Why

ME-3A persistent-thread delivery and every later Module Engineer coordination flow require durable module/assignment communication. Reusing Task Inbox as an open payload would collapse task/claim and engineer/binding identity; duplicating every store mechanic would create drift. ME-1C must preserve Task Inbox bytes while adding a closed Engineer message authority whose Provider delivery is strictly persist-first and non-authoritative.

## Goal

Deliver Approved ME-1C: shared closed message mechanics with byte-identical TaskMessageV1 behavior, strict ModuleMessage event/receipt/observation schemas, git-common-dir durable inbox, current-Binding and assignment fences, resource-digest-gated acknowledgement, optional bounded-summary transport, and authenticated CLI/MCP consumption without any Task/Lease/Decision/Interface/Publication/Acceptance mutation.

## Scope

- In scope: ME-1C PRD promotion; closed shared mechanics; Module message/event/receipt/observation schemas; durable store; module/assignment scope; Binding rotation handling; resource digest checks; CLI/MCP send/list/ack; optional transport interface; architecture/workstream evidence; focused and full verification.
- Out of scope: TaskMessage wire changes; Decision/Interface state; Lease/Task/Publication/Acceptance mutation; Session wake or lifecycle; ME-3 concrete Provider transport; raw transcript or full resource copies; generic payloads; remote delivery; databases/daemons.
- Taste constraints: one authority per datum; exact-key schemas; sender derived at invocation boundary; persist event and pending receipt before transport; error observations never synthesize delivery; unknown/stale/mismatched state fails closed; no Provider or payload fallback.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

The direction is wrong if extracting mechanics changes one canonical Task Inbox byte or if a transport can run before immutable event plus pending receipt persistence. Cheapest proof: freeze existing Task event/receipt golden bytes and inject an event-store failure into one Module send while asserting transport call count remains zero.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: immutable module/assignment messages persist before optional transport and remain separate from every task/decision/acceptance authority.
- Edge cases: event conflict, persistence failure, stale Binding, rotation, adapter failure, later delivery, resource digest mismatch, invalid transition, unknown sender/subject/resource kind and bounded rendering.
- Regression risks: TaskMessage canonical bytes/store behavior, existing Engineer status/offers/acquire MCP tools, Binding rotation semantics and MCP restricted-profile boundaries.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: isolated `codex/me1c-engineer-inbox` from `main@a8a0c983bd93a2d75a2a64135d09f33aa6b95d8d`.
- Revert strategy: revert the ME-1C schema/store/CLI/MCP/tests/architecture/workflow files; no existing TaskMessage bytes or persisted stores are migrated.
