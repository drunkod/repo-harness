## Why

Real BRC execution passed the business regression but canonical acceptance rejected missing benchmark metadata and acquisition-owned workflow rewrites. Reject invalid metadata before dispatch and preserve the frozen business scope.

## Goal

Campaign admission validates canonical contract metadata without executing acceptance criteria; Fleet acquire preserves all authored workflow bytes while activating the acquired worktree.

## Scope

- In scope: trusted metadata preflight, Fleet activation, model-free regression and durable evidence.
- Out of scope: business allowlist exemptions, budget changes, stopped dispatch replay, model or browser changes.
- Taste constraints: <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

A valid admitted contract or fresh acquisition still causes canonical scope/metadata failure before its business command. Reproduce with the real packaged helpers in a disposable repository.

## Root Cause Evidence

- root_cause: src/effects/runtime/helper-runner.ts also omitted its package hook CLI from protected child environments, relying on an ambient global installation; src/cli/commands/campaign.ts runCampaignPlanningPreflight omits canonical verification metadata, and src/effects/fleet/acquire.ts defaultProject reruns authoring projection after proof freeze, rewriting tracked artifacts outside business allowed_paths.

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/archive/plan-20260910-0431-campaign-acceptance-preflight.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260910-1155-campaign-acceptance-preflight.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/archive/notes-20260910-1155-campaign-acceptance-preflight.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Exit Criteria (Machine Verifiable)

This block contains only non-executable artifact requirements. Define every
executable check once in the canonical Verification Plan below. Each check must
state its phase, cost, evidence policy, necessity, and input environment; a
missing or malformed plan fails closed.

```yaml
exit_criteria:
  files_exist:
    - docs/spec.md
  artifacts_exist:
    - .ai/harness/checks/latest.json
    - tasks/archive/notes-20260910-1155-campaign-acceptance-preflight.md

This is the sole executable verification authority. Use `baseline_with_delta`
only when a referenced immutable baseline plus named current delta checks prove
the intended coverage; do not infer that choice from paths or command text.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: canonical metadata and authored review availability are checked before claim and again in the fresh worktree; activation preserves frozen workflow bytes.
- Edge cases: missing/duplicate metadata, missing review declaration/file, outside symlink, and parent-only uncommitted review are rejected without dispatch.
- CI follow-up: run 34406126201 rejected the historical lifecycle fixture metadata and a clean packaged helper could not resolve its own hook CLI for Change Assessment. Reopen this same unpublished work-package; preserve original CI failure and validate the affected fixture consumers before another exact-head CI run.
- Regression risks: final codex-plugin P2 review-artifact finding is reproduced and fixed; final delta validation includes the actual acquisition and campaign authority guards. Initial acceptance run run-20260910T045053-88650 remains evidence only for ae213ada before this bounded review fix.
