# Independent supervision integration decisions

- Reuse `1d0c65a7` production containment components, not its old workflow state. Integrate on `d4852017` and retain the later finalization/FIFO/cancellation fixes.
- Controller authority uses the existing account-level process configuration, never a worker-selected Git path. Canonicalize the test home because macOS temporary paths may alias `/private`; explicitly inherit this configuration in spawned recovery tests because Bun snapshots child environments.
- Historical lifecycle tests model protected producer records for finalization; real Docker tests independently exercise actual producer/consumer boundaries. Neither is a real model canary.
- The Docker handoff recovery test uses a real version probe and a never-started worker container. Its observed result is reconciliation-required, charged once with no new lease owner.
- Development evidence: `/tmp/brc354-docker3.log` has 15 passes; `/tmp/brc354-spec.log` has 12 passes. The lifecycle baseline had one child-home mismatch; `/tmp/brc354-recovery-delta.log` verifies that fix and real never-started Docker recovery (2 passes). Final canonical verification owns acceptance.
- No runtime active admission change. No dependencies added. New containment core/effect own exact Docker configuration and host producer authority; the image/PID1 supplies the independent process boundary; new tests and the saved fixture exercise those actual boundaries.

> **Substantive Change SHA256**: `sha256:50a35e2971b83e9824b5c2502a8a848136cb5c89eee28ce9c242949c652edfd6`

- A stale running inspect followed by namespace exit made kill return nonzero. The controller now always requires fresh same-container inactivity readback within the original cleanup deadline. Deterministic regression failed before and passed after (`/tmp/brc354-kill-race-{before,after}.log`). Retain immutable lifecycle verification `vx-a9feb18d252440e5a024`; repeat only the Docker boundary and typecheck for this production delta.

- One directly blocking out-of-slice fix: evidence redaction treated the declared extensionless Dockerfile path as a secret-like token, invalidating the Change Assessment fingerprint after materialization. Preserve only structurally declared safe relative path-array entries; known-secret filtering remains unconditional. The exact regression failed before and all 42 event-store/projection checks passed after. Use the candidate local CLI to validate its own corrected producer; do not modify the installed global package.
