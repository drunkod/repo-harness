## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pending
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: exact package/policy pins, provider core/effect boundary, tests, packaged readback, and governing docs/workflow artifacts.
- Actual files changed: 33 tracked or newly added paths within the contract allowlist, plus the deterministic architecture projection manifest.
- Commands passed: 31 focused tests; TypeScript no-emit; full suite 3793 pass / 4 skip / 0 fail; clean-room AXR5; deploy SQL, architecture, task-sync, workflow, inspect-state, init dry-run, and diff checks.
- Residual risks: provider calls remain synchronous process starts; later orchestration must own aggregate call-count budgets.
- Reviewer action required: issue the content-bound AcceptanceReceipt after subject freeze.
- Rollback: revert the work-package commit; policy remains off and no Refactor Program state is persisted.

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: work-package planning, isolated contract worktree.
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: captured in the plan; implementation preserves upstream semantic authority, traces exact request-to-CLI-to-envelope identity, and reuses the existing package/Node/process boundary.
- Root cause or plan evidence: `plans/archive/plan-20260904-0525-refactor-provider-contract.md` and packaged 0.5.2 readback.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run:
- Commands run: contract exit criteria plus focused provider suites and `git diff --check`.
- Manual checks: diff review confirmed no local module measurement/classification, fallback, PATH provider, or state mutation path.
- Supporting artifacts: `docs/verification/axr5-archctx-clean-room-readback.json`.
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes.
- Run snapshot:

- Summary: No AcceptanceReceipt has been recorded.
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Both architecture and refactor providers now bind exact published 0.5.2.
- Refactor scan/record/verify each perform their stage handshake before invocation and reject malformed, stale, or cross-request output.
- Upstream `AC_*` errors remain unchanged; local errors cover only version, transport/result, and stale identity boundaries.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- The adapter intentionally has no cache; process-start cost is bounded per call and aggregate budgets belong to Module 4 orchestration.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 10/10 | Focused and packaged end-to-end contracts pass. |
| Product depth | 9/10 | Module 3 boundary is complete; later PRD modules remain out of scope. |
| Design quality | 10/10 | One provider authority and one shared process path. |
| Code quality | 10/10 | Closed validation, identity binding, and regression coverage. |

## Failing Items

- None in the verified scope; AcceptanceReceipt remains pending.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: contract exit criteria from the active plan.
- Re-check: exact capabilities, request/assessment/worktree binding, and architecture projection regression.

## Summary

- Implementation is ready for content-bound acceptance and PR publication.
