## Why

Campaign acquisition equality currently seals a global stop before the acquired work can dispatch.

## Goal

Enforce the original acquisition cap while allowing acquired campaign work to complete under remaining limits.

## Scope

- In scope: campaign-only acquisition exhaustion and refusal semantics; model-free budget regressions.
- Out of scope: higher caps, historical receipt migration, non-campaign semantics, provider execution during repair.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

A cap1 campaign either admits a second acquisition or refuses its subsequent dispatch solely because acquisitions equal1.

## Root Cause Evidence

- root_cause: budget-store.ts exhaustionRefusal globally stops campaigns on acquisition equality; reserveAutomationBudgetAdmission also seals acquisition-only refusals.

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/archive/plan-20260910-0159-campaign-acquisition-cap.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260910-0210-campaign-acquisition-cap.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/archive/notes-20260910-0210-campaign-acquisition-cap.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

PR385 recovery, C7 and shadow fixture deltas are accepted baselines. This slice verifies only the new campaign acquisition behavior plus named affected regression suites. No local full suite; no historical stop receipt reopened.

## Rollback Point

Revert the acquisition-cap delta; retain all persisted historical stop receipts.
