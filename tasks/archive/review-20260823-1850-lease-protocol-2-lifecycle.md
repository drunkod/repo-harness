## Human Review Card

- Verdict: PASS
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: Lease schema/lifecycle core and effects, publication/sprint CLI, ship helper mirror, board projection, tests, and workflow artifacts listed by the contract.
- Actual files changed: 22 files in commit `70ace994`, all inside Allowed Paths.
- Commands passed: focused 175-test suite; closeout journal 23/23; helper scripts 130/130 outside sandbox; full suite 2844 pass, 2 platform skips, 0 fail; typecheck and root required checks.
- Residual risks: provider-fetch reconcile and broader recovery remain explicitly assigned to WP0-C.
- Reviewer action required: none; record the exact-subject AcceptanceReceipt.
- Rollback: revert WP0-B as one unit and retain schema-2 records for a capable reader.

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: user-approved work-package with explorer, architecture review, worker, and independent gatekeeper.
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: Plan Captured Planning Output plus implementation notes; gate traced `completing -> reviewing -> crash -> reconcile` end to end.
- Root cause or plan evidence: user-approved PRD v3 WP0-B and frozen contract falsifiers.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: independent gatekeeper PASS after one HIGH crash-recovery finding was corrected and re-reviewed.
- Commands run: all commands in contract Exit Criteria; full suite result `2844 pass / 2 skip / 0 fail`.
- Manual checks: `COORDINATION_PROTOCOL = 1`; source/template helper equality; ship and finish transaction keys remain distinct; Allowed Paths exact.
- Supporting artifacts: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json` will be frozen by `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`.
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes.
- Run snapshot: full suite completed in 754.31s outside the filesystem/process sandbox.

- Summary: User explicitly approved user waiver for workflow closeout in this task thread.
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Successful task-backed PR ship now durably enters `reviewing` after `pr_observed` and before ship completion.
- Reopen, takeover, abandon, and verified legacy migration are task-locked and exact-pointer fenced.
- Ordinary sprint release/steal/reconcile cannot mutate a reviewing lease.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- WP0-C must add fetch-backed publication reconcile and remaining recovery paths; WP0-B intentionally does not infer provider state.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 10/10 | Required transitions, refusals, and recovery guard verified. |
| Product depth | 9/10 | Complete WP0-B boundary; provider reconcile remains WP0-C by design. |
| Design quality | 10/10 | One current pointer authority; strict schema union; no digest-domain change. |
| Code quality | 9/10 | Focused and full suites pass; shell/template mirror is exact. |

## Failing Items

- None.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: contract Exit Criteria followed by `repo-harness run verify-sprint`.
- Re-check: exact AcceptanceReceipt subject/target binding after any semantic edit.

## Summary

- PASS. The prior recovery deadlock was fixed and independently re-reviewed; WP0-B is ready for AcceptanceReceipt finalization.
