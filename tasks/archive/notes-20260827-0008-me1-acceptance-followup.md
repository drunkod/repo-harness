## Design Decisions

- **ME-1B first-read convergence gates on the Profile authority, not on the aggregated component row.** `collectEngineeringBoard` now projects `engineers: []` unless `before.profiles` *and* `after.profiles` are both `available` (`src/effects/engineers/engineering-overlay.ts:266-274`). The Profile authority names the projection's rows, so a pass that lost it observed no Engineers at all; letting the surviving pass repopulate the roster is what made the two read directions disagree and violated the core invariant `unreadable profiles require an empty fully degraded projection` (`src/core/engineers/engineering-overlay.ts:320-323`). Reading the gate off `before/after` directly rather than off the already-computed `components` row keeps the authority relationship explicit instead of round-tripping through a derived projection.
- **ME-1C evaluates the assignment fence before the terminal-state check.** In `receiveModuleInbox` the stale-fence branch now runs first and admits `pending` and `delivered` (`src/effects/engineers/module-inbox.ts:668-681`). `acknowledged` and `superseded` keep the early return, which matches `supersedeModuleMessageReceipt` already accepting exactly `pending|delivered` (`src/core/engineers/module-message.ts:490-501`); no core change was needed. Ordering the fence first — rather than adding `delivered` to a second branch after the early return — keeps one place that decides "this receipt is addressed to a fence the principal cannot acknowledge".
- **The ME-1A N-way election proves mutual exclusion with a nested competitor, not with threads.** `acquireScheduledEngineerTask` is synchronous, so eight sequential attempts against shared claim state would only prove serialization: the loser's first `selectCurrentOffer` already sees the claimed graph and never reaches the lock. The test therefore launches one competitor from *inside* the winner's `acquire` callback, while the winner still holds the real lock and before the shared `claimed` flag flips (`tests/unit/me1a-engineer-scheduling-acquire.test.ts`). That competitor passes the pre-lock revalidation and then hits real `ExclusiveLockContentionError`, which is the only way to observe `engineer_concurrency_unavailable` through the production `withConcurrencyLock`. Production `LOCK_WAIT_MS` is 5s and the lock helper takes no timeout override from this call path, so the test costs ~5s and carries an explicit 30s per-test budget. The lock directory's parent is asserted present and the lock directory itself absent afterwards, which is what distinguishes a real lock from a stub.
- **ME-1B Fleet isolation now reads the fixture, so the fixture had to grow.** The previous `fleetBytes()` projected hard-coded literals and was true regardless of repository state. Replacing it with `collectFleetBoard` over the same repo required the fixture to become Fleet-visible: `.ai/harness/policy.json`, `.ai/harness/sprint/active-sprint`, a one-row canonical sprint, and a matching `demo.work-graph.v1.json` plus its policy/rollback authorities, along with a private `REPO_HARNESS_HOME` registry naming the repo `read_write`. `git init` is pinned to `-b main` because the policy's `merge_back.target` must name the branch the canonical sprint is read from. `observed_at` and `sequence` are pinned so any byte difference comes from repository state rather than the clock, and the three-view test asserts a non-empty card list and a projected `wp-a` first so the invariance assertions cannot pass vacuously.
- **Route inventory is an importer inventory, not a route-name grep.** Asserting the absence of a specific path string would silently pass if the route were renamed. The test instead enumerates every `.ts`/`.tsx` file under `src/` and pins the exact set that references the overlay module or `collectEngineeringBoard` to `cli/commands/engineer.ts` and the effects module itself, then asserts none of them live under `operator-web/` or `effects/operator/`. Adding any server-side consumer fails the equality, not just the prefix check.
- **`sprint graph` reuses the `engineer.ts` three-way whitelist verbatim** (`src/cli/commands/sprint.ts:33-44`): domain classes expose `.code`, a local `CliArgumentError` maps to `invalid_argument`, everything else is `internal_error`. Two domain classes are reachable on this path, so both are whitelisted: `EngineerSchedulingError` and `RepoHarnessRegistryStrictError`. The other `sprint` subcommands already route through `writeOutcome` and were left alone.

## Deviations From Plan Or Spec

- None.

## Tradeoffs Considered

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| ME-1B: gate `engineers` on the derived `components` row vs. on `before/after` profile reads | Gate on `before.profiles`/`after.profiles` | Same result, but states the authority relationship at the point of use instead of re-reading a projection that was just derived from it |
| ME-1C: add `delivered` to a second supersede branch after the early return vs. hoist the fence above it | Hoist the fence | One decision site for "addressed to a fence this principal cannot acknowledge"; a second branch would have duplicated the three-field comparison |
| `sprint graph`: whitelist only `EngineerSchedulingError` vs. also `RepoHarnessRegistryStrictError` | Whitelist both | `readRepoHarnessRegistryStrictSnapshot` is called directly in this action and its `fleet_registry_invalid`/`fleet_registry_unavailable` codes are the machine signal a caller needs; flattening them to `internal_error` would have moved the bug rather than fixed it |
| ME-1A election: spawn real OS processes vs. nest a competitor inside the lock window | Nest the competitor | Same observable — one delegation to ME-0B, a typed `engineer_concurrency_unavailable` for the competitor — without a process harness, and it still runs the production lock against a real git common directory |
| ME-1B Fleet isolation: keep a synthetic snapshot vs. project the fixture | Project the fixture | The synthetic snapshot was independent of the repository, so it could not fail; the cost is a heavier fixture and ~2s of real Fleet collection |

## Open Questions

- **Sibling of the ME-1B defect, deliberately left unfixed (out of contract scope).** The same before/after asymmetry exists one level down: if `bindings`, `claims`, `messages`, or `provider_effects` is unreadable in only *one* pass while profiles stay readable, `components[c].support` is `unreadable` (intersection of both passes) while the per-Engineer projection comes from `after` alone and reports `available`, which trips `${component} component support does not match Engineer observations` (`src/core/engineers/engineering-overlay.ts:325-336`). The profile-level fix does not cover it, and covering it needs a decision this task did not authorize: which pass owns the per-Engineer component read when the two passes disagree, and what a per-Engineer read means for an Engineer that only exists in `after`. Raised for the parent agent rather than resolved here.

## Evidence Links

- Checks: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`

## Promotion Filter

Promote a candidate to `tasks/lessons.md`, `docs/researches/`, or harness asset files only when all three hold: hard to reverse, surprising without local context, and a real trade-off existed. If any one is missing, keep it in this notes file instead.

## Promotion Candidates

- Promote to `tasks/lessons.md` only after a repeated correction or failure pattern.
- Promote to `docs/researches/` only when it is durable repo knowledge with evidence.
- Promote to harness asset files only after verification across more than one task or fixture.
