## Why

The Task Board's one write is the only place a human addresses a running agent
session, so a composer that misnames its target is worse than a missing one: it
tells the operator nobody holds a task whose claim it is printing two panels
higher, and the operator sends into a queue believing it will not be read. The
same panel fails AA on its single write control, discards a typed message when
the IME cancel key is pressed, and renders server English inside a Chinese
board. If this ships wrong, the board keeps looking authoritative while stating
facts the Fleet snapshot contradicts.

## Goal

The composer names its actual target for every lease state in both locales, the
send button clears 4.5:1 in every state it renders, Escape cannot discard a
draft, error copy is client-owned and keyed by the typed code, the worklist
counts cards and repositories where each is labelled, the footer reports an
unobserved protocol as absent, and the browser fixture is a payload the
production decoder accepts without a test-side rewrite.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - `src/operator-web/App.tsx` composer target copy, Escape guard, counts
    authority, footer protocol, localized error and aria surfaces.
  - `src/operator-web/i18n.ts` lease-state target sentences, repository and API
    error copy in `en` and `zh`, aria labels.
  - `src/operator-web/types.ts` nullable `^sha256:[0-9a-f]{64}$` for
    `inbox.effect_sha256`; exported closed code vocabularies.
  - `src/operator-web/styles.css` `.composer__send` colour pair.
  - `src/operator-web/fixture.ts` decoder-valid identity plus lease-state cards.
  - `tests/operator-web/**` and `tests/unit/operator-web-types.test.ts` guards;
    removal of the test-side `decodableSnapshot` identity rewrite.
- Out of scope:
  - server, collector, inbox, any protocol change, any new dependency.
  - the POST envelope and the scope decision: `task` scope for a non-bound lease
    is correct because the server accepts claim scope only for `bound`.
  - a client-side `counts.unclassified` total; the server-side field lands in a
    sibling work package.
- Taste constraints: no browser modal dialogs, no new dependency, both `en` and
  `zh` copy for every new string, 44px minimum targets at 900px and below.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

If `src/effects/fleet/task-inbox.ts` accepted claim-scoped delivery for a lease
that is not `bound`, the defect would be the scope decision rather than the
copy, and this change would be papering over a real routing bug. Cheapest proof
point: `sendTaskMessageWithAuthority` fails `recipient_unavailable` whenever
`record.state !== 'bound'` (`src/effects/fleet/task-inbox.ts:718`), so task
scope is the only delivery a non-bound lease can accept.

## Root Cause Evidence

- root_cause: the composer derived all of its copy from `composerScope`, which
  returns `'task'` for every lease that is not `bound`, so a card with a live
  `claim_id` under `reserving`/`completing`/`reviewing`/`unknown` rendered
  "Nobody holds this task now" while the identity panel printed that claim
  (`src/operator-web/App.tsx:1272-1283`, `:1485-1559` before this change).
- repro: `bun test --timeout 60000 tests/operator-web/operator-interactions.test.tsx`
  with the lease-state fixture; in the browser, open a task whose lease is
  `reserving` with a live claim and expand the composer.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: the composer names the holder and its lease state for a
  live claim under any non-bound lease, keeps scope `task` and the POST envelope
  unchanged, and still says nobody holds an unheld task.
- Edge cases: `bound` with no recorded claim, and a claim that appears after a
  task-scoped draft was frozen, each get their own sentence rather than reusing
  another state's. An error code outside the closed set renders the server's
  English labelled as untranslated.
- Regression risks: the composer copy keys are exhaustive `Record`s over the
  lease-state union, so a protocol that adds a lease state fails typecheck here.
  The `.composer__send` disabled pair overrides the shared button's opacity;
  a future change to `.operator-button:disabled` ordering could re-apply it.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: 1a9a5ae1 (branch base)
- Revert strategy: revert the two commits on `codex/operator-web-composer-truth`;
  `src/operator-web/**` and `tests/**` move together and nothing outside the
  browser bundle depends on them.
