## Why

The operator board is the only human rendering surface for fleet task state (CLI `fleet board` requires `--json`). Today it is an acceptance shell: real 64-hex `task_id`s render as unreadable card titles (the human label from the sprint Task cell is read into `BoardTaskInput.row` but dropped by the projection), the attention list is unsorted and cause-free, `feedback.no_progress` is decoded but never rendered, and the read-only boundary blocks the user-approved task-message channel. If this ships wrong, the operator either cannot triage (misses user-owned blockers) or the single write action leaks beyond its fence (message sent against a torn snapshot or into a read_only repo).

## Goal

Rebuild `src/operator-web/` as an attention-first decision surface per the approved plan (`plans/plan-20260828-2326-operator-board-redesign.md`, frozen decisions section): single priority-ordered worklist + persistent detail pane + persistent status bar, human task labels projected additively into `FleetBoardCardV1` with `FLEET_BOARD_PROTOCOL` bumped to 2, and one write action — a task-message composer wired to a new `POST /api/v1/fleet/tasks/{repository_id}/{task_id}/messages` endpoint wrapping the existing `sendTaskMessage` effect with `sender_kind: 'operator'`.

## Scope

- In scope: `src/core/fleet/board.ts`, `src/effects/fleet/board.ts`, `src/operator-web/**` (including a new dictionary-based zh/en i18n module `src/operator-web/i18n.ts`, no third-party i18n library, default locale en), `src/effects/operator/server.ts`, and their tests (`tests/operator-web/**`, board/fleet projection tests, operator server tests); the plan's WP-A/WP-B/WP-C task breakdown.
- Out of scope: `sendTaskMessage` effect internals and the task-message protocol (`src/core/fleet/task-message.ts` semantics stay untouched except reading existing constants); CLI commands; `FleetBoardInboxSummaryV1` receipt-state extension (deferred, recorded in tasks/todos.md); any second write action; SSE/watch endpoints; release/publish.
- Taste constraints: the accent color marks human-write affordances only; semantic colors (user=amber, agent=neutral blue, external=purple, danger=red for real failures only) are separate from the accent; minimum text size 11px, text contrast ≥ 4.5:1, non-text indicators ≥ 3:1 with a non-color secondary encoding.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.
- Stop if projecting `row.task`/`row.index` turns out to require a non-additive change to `BoardTaskInput` collection (that widens authority and needs a parent decision).

## Falsifier

Direction is wrong if real sprint `task` cells are not usable labels (long free-text markdown instead of short titles). Cheapest proof: `rg -m 6 "^\|" plans/archive/*.sprint.md` — verified 2026-08-28, cells are short work-package titles ("WP1 crash-durable closeout transaction"), so the label projection wins. Also wrong if the worklist regroups so aggressively that stage distribution becomes invisible; proof point is the detail-pane empty state carrying the repo × stage matrix.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260828-2326-operator-board-redesign.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260828-2326-operator-board-redesign.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/20260828-2326-operator-board-redesign.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Regression risks:

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: worktree base `97468edb` (main @ 0.17.1)
- Revert strategy: single feature branch `codex/operator-board-redesign`; protocol bump and UI rebuild land atomically, so reverting the merge restores protocol 1 and the old UI together. No data migration, no persisted state.
