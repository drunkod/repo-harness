## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass (external, Codex read-only review round 4)
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: the characterization test, the repair-campaign fixtures, the authority
  freeze research doc, the campaign architecture request and its boundary snapshot, plus this row's
  plan/contract/review/notes.
- Actual files changed: as intended, plus the two queue-generated artifacts
  `docs/architecture/index.md` and `docs/architecture/.projection-manifest.json`, both declared in
  Allowed Paths. `git diff origin/main...HEAD --stat -- src` is empty.
- Commands passed: `bun test tests/characterization --timeout 60000` (27/27),
  `bun run check:type`, `repo-harness run verify-contract --strict` (13/13 Fulfilled),
  `repo-harness run check-task-workflow --strict`, `check-task-sync.sh` (merge-base against
  origin/main), `bash scripts/check-architecture-sync.sh` (blocking=0).
- Residual risks: the freeze is only as strong as its subjects. Three P2/P3 wording advisories from
  round 4 remain open and are listed under Follow-ups; none changes behavior or an assertion.
- Reviewer action required: none for this row.
- Rollback: revert branch `codex/brc0-authority-freeze-baseline-characterization`. No `src/` change;
  the only shared state is the pending architecture request and its index entry, which
  `repo-harness run architecture-queue reindex` reconciles.

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: planning (contract-mode sprint row expanded in place)
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: `plans/archive/plan-20260903-0954-brc0-authority-freeze-baseline-characterization.md`
  sections `### P1 map`, `### P2 trace`, `### P3 decision rationale`.
- Root cause or plan evidence: not a bugfix; the plan's Task Breakdown is the execution evidence.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: replaced by four `codex exec -s read-only` review rounds. Rounds 1-3 returned
  REJECT with 16 findings (6 P1); every one was repaired structurally and none was waived. Round 4
  returned ACCEPT with no P0 and no P1.
- Commands run: see the Human Review Card above.
- Manual checks: two assertions were falsified by hand to prove they are not vacuous. Adding a
  fourth `base_sha` field to a campaign marker and regenerating the observation digests fails the
  marker freeze; setting a slot state to `incomplete` fails the PRD-vocabulary check.
- Supporting artifacts: `docs/researches/20260903-repair-campaign-authority-freeze.md`,
  `tests/fixtures/repair-campaign/authority-freeze-baseline.json`,
  `docs/architecture/snapshots/2026-09-03-development-campaign-boundary-declaration.md`.
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes; the notes record all four review rounds and the two deviations
  from the dispatched slice.
- Run snapshot: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json` (status pass, subject
  `sha256:76f7d07244c8ee6ec1f56496b00d745040b2258a2a52fe74ba29d1d0fcabc5dc`).

## Follow-ups (round 4 advisories, non-blocking)

- The plan's P2 trace still calls the external-source binding the strongest falsifier for "an Issue
  is not a Task"; the research doc and the test already name `lookupCanonicalTask` as the authority.
- The boundary snapshot's "Task and Lease only through the acquire chain" is exact for Lease; Task
  identity also enters through the campaign's canonical Sprint materialization, which the same
  document describes correctly further down.
- The notes' open-questions section still says the fixtures use `expected_outcome`; they now use
  `expected_slot_states`.

- Summary: Codex read-only review round 4: ACCEPT. Rounds 1-3 raised 16 findings (6 P1); all were repaired structurally, none waived. Remaining items are P2/P3 wording advisories in the plan, boundary snapshot and notes. src diff is empty; all 19 changed files are inside Allowed Paths.
- Findings: none
