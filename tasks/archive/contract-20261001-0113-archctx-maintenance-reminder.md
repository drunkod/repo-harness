## Why

CLI-only readiness hides a stale shared daemon; implicit recovery would interrupt other clients.

## Goal

Managed update must detect stale shared daemon and runtime mismatch diagnostics must request authorization before replacement/index rebuild.

## Scope

- In scope: lifecycle status probe, typed recovery reminder, existing tests and runbook.
- Out of scope: restarting the host daemon, rebuilding/deleting indexes, package upgrades.
- Taste constraints: <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

What observable evidence would prove this task's direction wrong, and the cheapest proof point to check first. Leave as-is if not applicable.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear as a `package_test` check in Verification Plan).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/archive/plan-20261001-0018-archctx-maintenance-reminder.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20261001-0113-archctx-maintenance-reminder.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/archive/notes-20261001-0113-archctx-maintenance-reminder.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Exit Criteria (Machine Verifiable)

This block contains only non-executable artifact requirements. Define every
executable check once in the canonical Verification Plan below. Each check must
state its phase, cost, evidence policy, necessity, and input environment; a
missing or malformed plan fails closed. Populate artifact requirements only
for deliverables this task actually owns; do not create a spec, notes or report
merely to fill this template.

```yaml
exit_criteria:
  files_exist: []
  artifacts_exist: []

Author the actual checks using [Testing Policy and Artifact Standards](../../docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md#testing-policy-and-artifact-standards).
The empty array is not permission to omit required repository checks: retain it
only when no executable criterion applies and explain why in Acceptance Notes.
Prefer existing covering tests; creating a task-named test or adding typecheck
is not a template requirement. For each selected check declare `id`, `kind`,
`cwd`, `phase`, `cost`, `evidence_policy`, `necessity`, `inputs.env`, and its
`command` or `path`. Declare the same execution once, including checks nested
inside aggregate scripts. Use `baseline_with_delta` only with an immutable
baseline and named current delta checks; never infer it from paths or command text.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Changed behavior/boundary: separate static CLI capabilities from daemon lifecycle status; keep recovery behind user approval.
- New test case/file rationale: extend existing suites to cover dispatch and authorization boundaries; no new test file.
- Selected checks: focused, types and required integrity gates; omit full suite because two covering integration suites exercise the changed dispatch and update paths.
- Full/expensive check justification: two existing integration suites cover process dispatch and update transactions; approximately 60 seconds. No full suite.
- Execution/baseline references, subject, current delta and disposition:
- Residual risks: real shared daemon replacement is outside this slice; upstream status may recover stale control files.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: base dc77b3c6.
- Revert strategy: revert only this bounded change.
