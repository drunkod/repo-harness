## Why

The old 0.19.1 tag omits accepted changes through 7f6fcd1f. The owner chose to
publish current main under the same version. Release metadata and current
package evidence must agree before moving the tag or publishing to npm.

## Goal

Prepare the updated 0.19.1 release documentation and one verified current-main
package boundary for integration. Publication follows as an authorized operator
chain after this work-package is accepted and merged.

## Scope

- In scope: docs/CHANGELOG.md, the existing 0.19.1 release filing, and this workflow family.
- In scope amendment (owner approved 2026-09-13): repair all observed release-gate blockers, including Oracle/tooling, Fleet retry, MCP fixed-goal execution, global runtime fixtures, lane environment isolation, verification concurrency and benchmark artifact preparation. Preserve production deadlines, existing assertions and the four-file release pool.
- Out of scope: unrelated product behavior, other worktrees and deferred CI tasks.
- Taste constraints: preserve operator migration warnings; no unverified performance or publication claims.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

An existing npm 0.19.1, moved remote tag, failing full release gate, missing
packaged files or mismatched installed-runtime identity blocks publication.
The cheap preflight is the npm absence and version check.

## Root Cause Evidence

- root_cause: The nested lane test inherits the outer release gate flag; concurrency assumes second-request admission within a fixed 0.5-second sleep; benchmark preparation spends 19.6 seconds compressing a 310 MiB dependency closure. Fresh executable fixture cold starts exceed the CodeGraph 1-second readiness probe window, while the Oracle test counts preflight startup against its unrelated 8-second cleanup budget. Instrumented Oracle work lasts 5118 ms; its first Gitleaks probe alone lasts 3251 ms.
- repro: Injecting 750 ms before the second verification CLI reproduces status 0 instead of waiting; running the lane test with REPO_HARNESS_TEST_EXPENSIVE=1 reproduces its wrong functional-lane value. The complete frozen release run vx-88142df9a8bf4c73ae25 records all seven subsequent failures. Four concurrent isolated existing CodeGraph/resolver test runs reproduce missing version log and extra retry probe; the instrumented Oracle timeout test fails at 8569 ms while actual Oracle cleanup remains within its budget.

- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260913-1339-release-0191-current.md`

- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Exit Criteria (Machine Verifiable)

This block contains only non-executable artifact requirements. Define every
executable check once in the canonical Verification Plan below. Each check must
state its phase, cost, evidence policy, necessity, and input environment; a
missing or malformed plan fails closed. Populate artifact requirements only
for deliverables this task actually owns; do not create a spec, notes or report
merely to fill this template.

```yaml
exit_criteria:
  files_exist:
    - docs/CHANGELOG.md
    - deploy/release-checklists/260912-repo-harness-0.19.1.md
  artifacts_exist:
    - tasks/archive/notes-20260913-1339-release-0191-current.md
```

## Verification Plan

```json
{
  "protocol": 1,
  "checks": [
    {
      "id": "version",
      "kind": "command",
      "command": "bun scripts/check-skill-version.ts",
      "cwd": ".",
      "phase": "preflight",
      "cost": "normal",
      "evidence_policy": "current_exact",
      "necessity": "Both version authorities and README stamps must agree on 0.19.1",
      "inputs": {

      }
    },
    {
      "id": "release-lane-regression",

      "path": "tests/expensive-test-gate.test.ts",
      "cwd": ".",
      "phase": "preflight",
      "cost": "normal",
      "evidence_policy": "current_exact",
      "necessity": "Bugfix Root Cause Evidence H1 requires its captured failing guard as an explicit package_test; this two-second mandatory preflight is the sole aggregate-overlap exception",
      "inputs": {
        "env": []
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "release",
      "kind": "command",
      "command": "REPO_HARNESS_DIFF_BASE=origin/main REPO_HARNESS_DIFF_MODE=merge-base BUN_TEST_ISOLATE_FILES=1 BUN_TEST_JOBS=4 BUN_TEST_MAX_CONCURRENCY=1 bun run check:release",
      "cwd": ".",
      "phase": "verification",
      "cost": "expensive",
      "evidence_policy": "current_exact",
      "necessity": "Explicit owner-authorized release gate includes real install and Herdr cases omitted by hosted functional CI, required integrity checks and tarball runtime smoke",
      "inputs": {
        "env": []
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Author the actual checks using [Testing Policy and Artifact Standards](../../docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md#testing-policy-and-artifact-standards).
The empty array is not permission to omit required repository checks: retain it
only when no executable criterion applies and explain why in Acceptance Notes.
Prefer existing covering tests; creating a task-named test or adding typecheck
is not a template requirement. For each selected check declare `id`, `kind`,
`cwd`, `phase`, `cost`, `evidence_policy`, `necessity`, `inputs.env`, and its
`command` or `path`. Declare the same execution once, including checks nested
inside aggregate scripts. Use `baseline_with_delta` only with an immutable
baseline and named current delta checks; never infer it from paths or command text.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Changed boundary: release documentation and candidate/package identity. The
  existing release gate owns the needed runtime and archive checks.
- No new tests: the full gate includes readme assertions and the packaging
  smoke; listing those leaves separately would duplicate execution.
- Expected full-gate cost: 15-25 minutes with a four-file pool; normal hosted
  functional CI is not an expensive-case substitute.
- The runtime_readback oracle is the real tarball installation already nested
  in check:release. The publication readback is a later operator step.
- Owner authorization permits publication and moving the old tag, but this
  contract still requires its frozen reviewer for semantic acceptance.

## Rollback Point

- Integration base: 7f6fcd1f143e77fd007f43d39e9fe5a7029583fb.
- Before publication, revert this documentation work-package and preserve npm
  absence. The old remote tag object is recorded in the release filing.
