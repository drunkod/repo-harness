## Why

AKN-03c is blocked after a committed provider apply and a failed consumer refresh. Retrying acceptance currently repeats apply and cannot finish the missing consumer receipt.

## Goal

Provide explicit supported recovery of the exact interrupted acceptance, retaining provider-owned committed evidence and completing refresh and receipt publication once.

## Scope

- In scope: exact-candidate recovery in acceptance/provider/CLI, focused regression guards and owning documentation; approved 0.5.11 dependency integration across both consumers, generated policy defaults and existing version-bound fixtures. The user also approved repo-harness 0.19.3 release metadata, package verification and npm publication using Web Auth. Owner-approved (2026-09-25) third release-gate repair: installed-copy tree hashing through the single TS authority and `.codegraph/` rsync exclusion. Codex acceptance review P1 (refresh-owned mutation strands recovery) is recorded as a known fail-closed limitation; the fix requires an archctx provider recovery proof and is deferred.
- Out of scope: global runtime installation, provider internal journal edits, H0 admission, manual receipt creation, unrelated AKN-03c changes and new approval grants.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

Recovery repeats semantic apply, accepts another approval or changed snapshot, discards original refresh signals, or writes a receipt without committed provider proof.

## Root Cause Evidence

- root_cause: src/effects/architecture/projection-acceptance.ts:175-178 runs provider apply again when the acceptance receipt is absent after a committed apply and failed refresh, because the committed result is not durably recorded before refresh at line 188.
- repro: bun test tests/architecture-projection-provider.test.ts --timeout 60000
- regression_guard: tests/architecture-projection-provider.test.ts
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: .ai/harness/runs/accept-recovery/pre-fix.log

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Missing invariant: committed apply plus failed refresh must recover using the same approval without replaying semantic writes. Existing acceptance tests only cover retries after a consumer receipt exists.
- Extend existing acceptance tests at the lowest provider boundary; provider/e2e cases cover actual public CLI protocol. No new test files; the subsequently approved 0.19.3 release requires the full release gate in Verification Plan.
- Root integrity checks plus explicit root-required init dry-run are retained. The init dry-run is an evidence producer outside canonical command checks as required by Verification Execution Boundary.
- The release gate is estimated at 20–40 minutes and includes isolated installed-runtime tests. Shared live daemon mutation is outside scope.
- Diagnosis agent may update the four Root Cause Evidence fields after producing the pre-fix artifact; production edits wait for confirmed root cause and protocol freeze.
- Canonical acceptance remains required before ship; no automatic human waiver.

## Rollback Point

- Base: 80fb3339fc2c96355d9696663d528e3485b91a97.
- Revert only isolated source changes; retain original provider/consumer evidence and original AKN worktree.
