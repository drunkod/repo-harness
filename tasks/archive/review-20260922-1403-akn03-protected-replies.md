## Human Review Card

- Verdict: independent needs-attention; original and cumulative dependency findings corrected with pre-fix failures and targeted regressions; final canonical verification passed, owner acceptance pending.
- Change type: code-change; protected message disposition and current-request auth.
- Scope: roadmap sections 5.3 and 5.5-5.7, as frozen in the captured plan.
- P1/P2/P3: existing inbox authority; Binding to Task to mapping to registry lock order; original WorkEnvelope digest; synchronous OAuth recheck and physical crash boundaries.
- Rollback: revert named entrypoints and writer; preserve existing and partial records.
- Doc debt: none within the implemented slice; notification and Host acceptance remain explicit separate items.

## Verification Evidence

Development evidence: 16 effects tests plus the exact stored-path identity regression passed, including five real child exits and original-ID recovery, late token revocation, revoked mapping, rotated Lease, ACK recovery, orphan/missing records and bounded reads. The real Engineer OAuth HTTP smoke passed with exact inventory, SDK current-request token propagation and existing session isolation. Final canonical verification follows source and projection freeze; these development runs do not replace it.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Real Host/H0 protected-store isolation and legal Campaign canaries remain unproven; no runtime was installed or activated.
- Notification reconciliation under the exact runtime control reference is a later AKN-03 boundary.
- Initial authority validation is outside the read-scan deadline; shared mapping/registry locks prioritize consistency and may contend at higher concurrency.
- Stacked source includes PR #435. Its separately accepted inventory correction is retained, not re-authored.

## Independent Review Transcript

Review subject: `sha256:c87c011cd1e9865a9eff72640e8885d2073f6e1b22f67d304857de97db264211` at `57e236ec77e73ec6002d1ffe473922167f331e3c`. The provider verdict governs; the wrapper's advisory PASS label is not treated as acceptance.

      "body": "After intent publication, a restarted caller that lost its request body can discover only the reply ID and chain state here. replyToTaskSteer requires the original body and rejects any different bytes, but no Engineer MCP tool exposes the stored intent or resumes it directly. Even with the original WorkEnvelope and live fence, the caller cannot recover this partial operation through the protected API.

}
```

## Review resolution

Both findings reproduced in `review-regressions-before.log`: exact whitespace was lost, and a fresh caller had no recovery body. The protected read now returns frozen retry bytes for incomplete chains; MCP passes original body bytes unchanged. Regression coverage generates the body exclusively inside the child that exits, then recovers through the authorized MCP read and reply tools. The existing current-fence check remains mandatory. Final canonical verification and owner acceptance follow the corrected source/projection freeze; the earlier reviewer verdict does not cover the new subject.

## AKN-04a dependency findings

The cumulative independent review rejected 75036305-derived behavior: unrelated canonical commits prevented ongoing communication, and full-history scan exhaustion prevented known-operation recovery. The owner request for the earlier f306 subject is superseded. `review-recovery-before.log` captured three failing regression cases. The corrected targeted run passed all three: communication survives unrelated canonical advancement while acquisition remains strict and changed Plan proof fails closed; authenticated exact-parent recovery survives both scan and byte exhaustion, retains immutable history, and rejects wrong digest, pagination mixing and revoked token. The code uses shared authority checks and an explicitly scoped exact-parent read requiring the original persisted intent. Unknown-parent discovery beyond the list bound remains incomplete and is not represented as solved.

No second independent review was run. Acceptance must bind the corrected source and canonical verification.

## Corrected canonical evidence

Source `92f1b3b68fb3920fc47ff5a9f63ce0c6a1ef1d0e`; subject `sha256:de587bc9199084e7c8eef152f9a528d34d878f684c1e46782a316312677c3379`. Canonical prepare-acceptance passed all 23 criteria with zero failures, including recovery/effects, acquisition effects, MCP/OAuth/HTTP, authority inventory, type and required repository integrity checks. Run: `.ai/harness/runs/run-20260922T040623-9736-20260922-0204-akn03-protected-replies.json`. Architecture materialization was noop with current proof. This is machine verification, not an AcceptanceReceipt. Explicit owner acceptance remains pending and the previous request does not cover this corrected subject.

## AKN-05a dependency finding: cursor ordering

- root_cause: observeTaskSteers sorted UUIDs with localeCompare but applied an exclusive code-point cursor; a valid uppercase UUID could be silently skipped.
- repro: bun test tests/effects/task-reply.test.ts --test-name-pattern 'mixed-case UUID pagination'
- regression_guard: tests/effects/task-reply.test.ts
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: .ai/harness/runs/akn05-reader-corrections/pagination-red.log (PRE_FIX_EXIT=1)

The original review rejection remains. This correction supersedes prior source-bound verification and owner-acceptance subjects; it is not a new external review or a passing receipt.

## Pagination correction architecture refresh

The authorized local index is current for source bd557f81. Deterministic architecture projection updates only the manifest; no human action or refresh signal was requested. Plan/apply receipts are `.ai/harness/runs/akn03-protected-replies/pagination-projection-{plan,apply}.json`. The corrected source is frozen for canonical verification; earlier de587bc9 verification and acceptance requests remain superseded.

## Final pagination correction verification

Canonical prepare-acceptance at `802b9da87de283f873ecc89c029f5031e466e939` passed all 23 criteria, including 19 executed checks, with zero failures and no snapshot change during execution. The exact normalized implementation subject is `sha256:39106a9170288dc78b696474265778fdbf7ee513ad8a56741ffeb7bff694ef68`. Evidence: `.ai/harness/runs/run-20260922T110720-33976-20260922-0204-akn03-protected-replies.json`; architecture acceptance materialization was noop.

The preceding attempt stopped at allowed-path preflight because the invocation omitted the stacked package base. The successful run explicitly used the contract's existing base `749e9e92cc0f3da384dfca4e24ebb20f39b98277` and merge-base mode; neither allowed paths nor checks were widened. The original independent rejection is retained. The AcceptanceReceipt remains pending; machine verification does not establish owner acceptance or installed Host admission.
