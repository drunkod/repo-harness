## Why

`verify-sprint` finalization re-emits already-redacted command evidence. The evidence writer then hashes an embedded redaction digest a second time, so an exact frozen subject loses its valid AcceptanceReceipt during the publication path. This currently blocks BYOK Step 4a after its full verification and acceptance have passed.

## Goal

Make `verify-sprint` finalization replay the immutable prepared run snapshot so repeated finalization preserves the exact receipt-bound command semantics and does not re-redact a materialized projection.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - Resolve and validate the immutable prepared run snapshot referenced by the receipt-verified checks projection.
  - Build the acceptance overlay from that raw snapshot, not from `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`.
  - Make repeated finalization a no-op once the same receipt-bound evidence is already finalized.
  - Keep the source helper and packaged helper mirror synchronized.
- Out of scope:
  - weakening secret detection, accepting stale receipts, changing BYOK product code, or adding compatibility/fallback semantics.
- Taste constraints: preserve full `commands` in the AcceptanceReceipt fingerprint and preserve persisted-event redaction as the fail-closed security authority.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

If replaying the raw prepared snapshot cannot reproduce the same materialized command evidence after one redaction pass, this direction is wrong. The cheapest proof is the projection-drift test that runs the shipped finalize overlay through the real event writer/materializer twice.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: `scripts/verify-sprint.sh:949-981` rebuilds finalized evidence from materialized `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`; the evidence writer redacts its embedded `sha256:<digest>` command marker again, so `scripts/acceptance-receipt.ts` correctly detects a changed `commands` fingerprint.
- repro: run the focused repeated-finalize guard in `tests/evidence-projection-drift.test.ts` against the unfixed source; the second materialization changes the command string from one redaction marker to two.
- regression_guard: tests/evidence-projection-drift.test.ts
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: .ai/harness/runs/pre-fix-acceptance-redaction-idempotence.log

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/archive/plan-20260904-0517-acceptance-redaction-idempotence.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260905-1312-acceptance-redaction-idempotence.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/archive/notes-20260905-1312-acceptance-redaction-idempotence.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

```

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: prepare and finalize command evidence materialize the same command identity, and a second finalize emits no divergent event.
- Edge cases: missing, unsafe, stale, or subject-mismatched run snapshots fail closed.
- Regression risks: trusting a mutable or unrelated snapshot would weaken the evidence chain, so the source snapshot must be validated against the receipt-verified projection before emission.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: exact branch subject recorded by `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`.
- Revert strategy: revert the helper, packaged mirror, focused test, and workflow artifacts as one unit.
