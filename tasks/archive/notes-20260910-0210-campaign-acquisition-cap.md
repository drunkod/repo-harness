## Design Decisions

- Campaign acquisition capacity is an admission limit; all subsequent operations retain their existing per-operation budgets.

## Deviations From Plan Or Spec

- None recorded.

## Tradeoffs Considered

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Campaign-only correction | Use | Preserve non-campaign stop semantics and all historical receipts. |

## Open Questions

- None.

## Evidence Links

- Checks: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`

## Promotion Filter

Promote a candidate to `tasks/lessons.md`, `docs/researches/`, or harness asset files only when all three hold: hard to reverse, surprising without local context, and a real trade-off existed. If any one is missing, keep it in this notes file instead.

## Promotion Candidates

- Promote to `tasks/lessons.md` only after a repeated correction or failure pattern.
- Promote to `docs/researches/` only when it is durable repo knowledge with evidence.
- Promote to harness asset files only after verification across more than one task or fixture.
