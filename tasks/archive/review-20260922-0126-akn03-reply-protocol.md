## Scope and mode

AKN-03a pure reply protocol only. P1/P2/P3 and fault oracle are frozen in the source plan. Existing Task message and principal validators remain authoritative. Protected persistence, authenticated MCP and real Host evidence remain future AKN-03 work.

## Verification Evidence

Development observation: 62 tests passed across task-reply and task-message-v1; typecheck passed. Canonical prepared verification passed all 12 executable checks. Independent codex-plugin review approved the same semantic subject sha256:8cfb46469a57b095864cec38cd5f3655971b6a27946a4c8ee6c306827695b5ea with no findings. AcceptanceReceipt recording remains pending. No filesystem/Host authentication claim follows from pure fixture success.

- Summary: No material blocking findings in the exact scoped changes against the pinned base. All 62 focused tests passed. Approval covers the pure protocol; authenticated storage and crash durability remain explicitly outside this slice.
- Findings: none

## Residual Risks

All production integration remains unwired. The next protected effect must validate current authorization and Lease/Binding/WorkEnvelope at both prepare and commit; structural completeness alone cannot authenticate records. PR #434 hosted CI found a preexisting timeout fixture mismatch outside this package; CI is not green.

This binds the archived review to the complete PR substantive diff against main at 0d4371c3. The local no-base task-sync check covered the working tree; hosted CI checks the complete branch diff. Product bytes and the independent review subject are unchanged.
