## Why

`discard_scaffold_dirty_paths` aborts halfway on macOS whenever every dirty
scaffold path is tracked: it restores the tracked paths first, then dies on the
untracked loop, leaving the operator with a non-zero exit and an `unbound
variable` message after their files were already reverted.

The defect predates `b456121a` but was nearly unreachable: squash-merged
branches were filtered out as unmerged and never entered the discard path, so
it only fired on `--no-ff` merges. Squash is this project's house flow and the
GitHub default, so the path is now routinely reachable. Issue #196's reporter,
clearing 100+ worktrees, is the likely first encounter — that issue already
carries a public warning to avoid `--discard-scaffold-only` until this lands.

## Goal

`ship-worktrees --cleanup-merged --discard-scaffold-only` completes on bash 3.2
when the dirty scaffold set contains zero untracked paths, and a test locks that
success path.

## Scope

- In scope: change `scripts/ship-worktrees.sh:806` to
  `for path in ${untracked_paths[@]+"${untracked_paths[@]}"}; do`; mirror to
  `assets/templates/helpers/ship-worktrees.sh` via `bun run sync:helpers`; add a
  success-path test covering a merged worktree whose dirty scaffold is entirely
  tracked.
- Out of scope: which paths count as scaffold, the refusal branches, the
  `--discard-scaffold-only` gate itself, `BASH_BIN` resolution, and any bash
  version bump. Only the empty-array expansion changes.
- Taste constraints: use the idiom already present twice in this same file at
  `:1085` and `:1105` (`${child_args[@]+"${child_args[@]}"}`). Do not introduce a
  different empty-array pattern, do not restructure the loop, and do not relax
  `set -euo pipefail`.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.
- Stop if the fix would change behavior when the array is non-empty. Word
  splitting and quoting must be preserved for elements containing spaces.

## Falsifier

If the guarded expansion changes iteration for a non-empty array — in
particular if an element containing a space is split into two iterations — the
fix is wrong regardless of the empty case passing. Cheapest proof:

```
/bin/bash -c 'set -euo pipefail; a=("p q" r); for x in ${a[@]+"${a[@]}"}; do echo "[$x]"; done'
```

must print `[p q]` and `[r]`, not `[p]` `[q]` `[r]`.

## Root Cause Evidence

- root_cause: scripts/ship-worktrees.sh:806 expands `"${untracked_paths[@]}"` under `set -euo pipefail`, and bash 3.2 (macOS `/bin/bash`, the `BASH_BIN` default at scripts/ship-worktrees.sh:7) raises `unbound variable` for an empty array, so discard_scaffold_dirty_paths exits 1 after already reverting the tracked paths.
- repro: /bin/bash -c 'set -euo pipefail; a=(); for x in "${a[@]}"; do echo "$x"; done; echo REACHED_END' prints `/bin/bash: a[@]: unbound variable` and exits 1; end to end, `ship-worktrees --cleanup-merged --discard-scaffold-only` against a merged worktree whose dirty scaffold is entirely tracked aborts the same way.
