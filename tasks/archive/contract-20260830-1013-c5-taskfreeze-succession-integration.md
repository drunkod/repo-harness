## Why

`HandoffExecutionContextV1.bound_task` names a `TaskFreezeReceiptV1` by digest and
a Claim by id, and nothing resolves either. `buildWorkStateHandoff()` validates
the branch's shape and stops, so a syntactically valid record can point at a
freeze receipt that does not exist or describes different bytes. If that ships,
the successor reconstructs a state nobody ever froze, and the frozen sentence --
handoff passes knowledge, TaskFreeze passes exact state, the Lease lifecycle
passes the right to execute -- is true in prose and false in code.

The second failure mode is the inverse: succession machinery that quietly grants
execution. A row that wires a successor to a handoff without going through
release / takeover / acquire would put successor election in the collaboration
plane, which is exactly the authority D1 froze out of it.

## Goal

Land `src/effects/collaboration/succession.ts` as the single join between the two
planes: derive a handoff's `bound_task` execution context from the persisted
freeze receipt so an unbound context cannot be published, prove the same binding
on read so a record from any other route is refused, refuse succession for a
dirty bound executor that has not frozen, and refuse a successor that has not
been granted a live Claim by the existing lifecycle. No new protocol, no new
store, no successor field, no second destination resolver.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - `src/effects/collaboration/succession.ts` (new; the only source file)
  - `tests/helpers/collaboration-succession-fixture.ts` (new; three-actor
    collaboration repository plus a real bound task)
  - `tests/effects/collaboration-succession.test.ts` (new)
  - `tasks/workstreams/runtime-harness/collaboration/collaboration-substrate-program.md`
  - `tasks/lessons.md`: the C4 sprint-backlog hand-edit correction
  - the architecture surface this row moves: `.archcontext/model/`,
    `docs/architecture/`, the controlled `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` blocks, and the
    AXR7 / e2e count pins in `tests/architecture-projection-e2e.test.ts`
- Out of scope:
  - `CollaborationRunContextBindingV1` and the context-packet store reader (C6)
  - CLI and MCP surfaces (C7); the Operator collaboration view (C8)
  - any edit to `src/core/collaboration/common.ts` (C1 owns it)
  - any edit to the delivery plane's stores, or any new Task/Lease/Publication/
    Acceptance authority
  - unblocking `delegated_worker` handoff adoption (decided in notes; stays for C6)
- Taste constraints: match the existing collaboration modules -- module docblock
  states the invariant and the failure it prevents, comments explain why at the
  boundary that owns the decision, no restating of the operation.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

The direction is wrong if a bound-task handoff can be published whose
`task_freeze_receipt_sha256` names no persisted receipt, or whose `claim_id` /
`lease_generation` / `work_envelope_sha256` disagree with the receipt it names.
Cheapest proof point: construct such a record through
`publishBoundTaskSuccessionHandoff()` and through `buildWorkStateHandoff()` +
`resolveBoundTaskSuccession()`, and confirm both refuse.

It is also wrong if adopting a handoff, on its own, moves any byte under
`repo-harness/coordination/v1` or `repo-harness/engineers/v1`. Cheapest proof
point: `deliveryPlaneDigest()` before and after.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260830-0858-c5-taskfreeze-succession-integration.review.md`

- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.
