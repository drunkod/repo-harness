## Why

The ME-1 acceptance round returned FAIL on all three slices: two runtime defects ship wrong behavior today (ME-1B first-read failure throws instead of degrading; ME-1C `delivered` receipts strand permanently after binding rotation), two error-code whitelist gaps mislead machine consumers, contract-promised tests were marked delivered but never written, and ME-1C is the only slice whose closeout never ran.

## Goal

Land the user-approved ME-1 follow-up: fix the four runtime/error-code defects with regression tests, deliver the missing ME-1A/ME-1B contract-promised tests, complete the ME-1C typed AcceptanceReceipt and archive, and make the archive tooling sync review headers and rewrite internal pointers.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - `src/effects/engineers/engineering-overlay.ts` first-read degraded convergence + regression test.
  - `src/effects/engineers/module-inbox.ts` rotation supersede for `delivered` assignment receipts + receive-then-rotate regression test.
  - `src/cli/commands/sprint.ts` layered error codes per the engineer.ts whitelist pattern + error-field assertions.
  - `src/cli/mcp/engineer-tools.ts` `ModuleMessageError` whitelist entry + `module_message_invalid` test.
  - ME-1A test debt: N-way concurrency election, `engineer_offers`/`engineer_acquire` MCP protocol tests, three blocker-branch fixtures, generic-v1 effects exclusion.
  - ME-1B test debt: real Fleet isolation bytes test, single-fixture three-view semantic independence, route-inventory assertion.
  - ME-1C closeout: allowed_paths amendment, typed AcceptanceReceipt, archive of its plan/contract/review/notes.
  - Archive tooling: review header/receipt sync and internal-pointer rewrite (smallest coherent change per the todos ledger entry).
- Out of scope:
  - ME-1B binding observation producer (needs ME-3A wiring decision), ME-1A cross-repo topology narrowing, listModuleInbox removal beyond a mechanical delete, PRD text fixes beyond the two safe_auto items, any push.
- Taste constraints: <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

What observable evidence would prove this task's direction wrong, and the cheapest proof point to check first. Leave as-is if not applicable.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260826-2233-me1-acceptance-followup.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260826-2233-me1-acceptance-followup.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/20260826-2233-me1-acceptance-followup.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.
