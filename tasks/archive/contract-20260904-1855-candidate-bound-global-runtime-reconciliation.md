## Why

The update transaction can commit a new global package with predecessor-generated host adapters and a stale ownership ledger. This creates mixed-version runtime state while status may still report ready.

## Goal

Make handoff-capable global runtime updates semantically atomic: the installed candidate version owns post-install reconciliation, emits a transaction-bound receipt, and is committed only after exact projection and ledger verification. Bound migration from pre-handoff releases to an explicit bootstrap invocation followed by one candidate-owned update.

## Scope

- In scope: candidate absolute-path handoff; typed receipt; exact adapter projection diagnostics; ownership-ledger convergence; doctor update action; rollback and version-bound fixtures.
- Out of scope: repo-local adoption semantics, unrelated architecture projection behavior, compatibility fallbacks, or a second managed-entry ownership detector.
- Taste constraints: Reuse the existing transaction, `isManagedEntry`, strip/merge projection, and `applyInstallProfile` authorities; fail closed on any candidate or receipt mismatch.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

If a fixture with an old parent builder returning timeout 30 produces timeout 150 after one update without a candidate process owning the write, the handoff diagnosis is wrong. The cheapest proof is a boundary test that records which process/version generated the adapter.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: `runGlobalRuntimeSetup()` in `src/cli/commands/global-runtime.ts` installs the candidate and then invokes the already-loaded parent `installHostAdapters()`, while `reconcileManagedRuntime()` verifies dependencies only, allowing predecessor adapter semantics and stale install-state to commit.
- repro: install a fixture candidate whose managed Stop timeout is 150 under an old updater fixture whose builder emits 30, run one update, then inspect the committed adapter and ledger.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: Candidate absolute-path reconciliation owns selected projections, exact verification, ledger refresh, and the receipt before parent commit.
- Edge cases: Same-count field drift, duplicate/extra routes, unmanaged siblings, forged/replayed capabilities, rollback, no-hooks partial state, and frozen legacy bootstrap are covered.
- Regression risks: Pre-handoff binaries cannot be retroactively made candidate-atomic; operators crossing that boundary must run the documented second update.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint:
- Revert strategy:
