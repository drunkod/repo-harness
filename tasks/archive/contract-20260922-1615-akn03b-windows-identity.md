## Why

Two Windows attempts at #437 head769c065c fail the successful mapped Engineer status call with engineer_principal_unmapped. Local HTTP and installed-package checks pass, so accepting the current fixture would hide an unresolved cross-platform identity failure.

## Goal

Isolate the exact parent/child mapping identity mismatch through the existing HTTP fixture, correct only a proven fixture cause, and obtain current Windows evidence.

## Scope

- In scope: existing HTTP fixture identity probes, a proven fixture-only correction, and exact validation evidence.
- Out of scope: production path/authorization semantics, main merge, runtime install, Host/Campaign/canary.
- Taste constraints: no platform skip, retry masking, invented mapping identity or new authority.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

The child and parent canonical mapping identities match yet the live HTTP request remains unmapped. Then a fixture-path correction is falsified and the actual server context must be traced before editing.

## Root Cause Evidence

- root_cause: tests/cli/mcp-http.test.ts hashes the Windows8.3 temp root before Git expands it; the server hashes the Git-expanded long root and finds no mapping.
- repro: Windows job106662452605 at255ecbb0 showed RUNNER~1 and runneradmin roots with different repo IDs, identical mapping_root and the same-token authorization assertion passed.
- regression_guard: tests/cli/mcp-http.test.ts
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: .ai/harness/runs/akn03b-windows-identity/windows-before.log

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/archive/plan-20260922-1548-akn03b-windows-identity.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260922-1615-akn03b-windows-identity.md`

- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Exit Criteria (Machine Verifiable)

This block contains only non-executable artifact requirements. Define every
executable check once in the canonical Verification Plan below. Each check must
state its phase, cost, evidence policy, necessity, and input environment; a
missing or malformed plan fails closed. Populate artifact requirements only
for deliverables this task actually owns; do not create a spec, notes or report
merely to fill this template.

```yaml
exit_criteria:
  files_exist: []
  artifacts_exist: []

Author the actual checks using [Testing Policy and Artifact Standards](../../docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md#testing-policy-and-artifact-standards).
The empty array is not permission to omit required repository checks: retain it
only when no executable criterion applies and explain why in Acceptance Notes.
Prefer existing covering tests; creating a task-named test or adding typecheck
is not a template requirement. For each selected check declare `id`, `kind`,
`cwd`, `phase`, `cost`, `evidence_policy`, `necessity`, `inputs.env`, and its
`command` or `path`. Declare the same execution once, including checks nested
inside aggregate scripts. Use `baseline_with_delta` only with an immutable
baseline and named current delta checks; never infer it from paths or command text.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Changed behavior/boundary, existing covering tests and remaining gap:
- New test case/file rationale, or why existing coverage is sufficient:
- Selected check IDs and why their coverage is sufficient; omitted coverage:
- Full/expensive check justification and expected cost, if applicable:
- Execution/baseline references, subject, current delta and disposition:
- Residual risks and incomplete observations:

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint:
- Revert strategy:

Test admission: add identity assertions to the existing failing Engineer OAuth E2E only. No new test file. The same real HTTP and installed-package test consumes them. The added diagnostic process uses disposable fixture identities, never live credentials or a real Host. Hosted Windows evidence is required before acceptance; local pass cannot substitute.
