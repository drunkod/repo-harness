## Design Decisions

- Keep stored planning proof usable for historical WorkEnvelope/recovery/closeout validation; apply current admission at the actual mutation boundaries and Fleet projection.
- Reuse readAutomationUsageForResult before recovery retirement/rebind. Null usage means a durable final awaits settlement, not permission for a new child.
- Fleet uses existing plan_not_projectable for current execution projection; protocol 4 remains unchanged.
- Replace active-success fixtures with explicit historical state and real Lease/ClaimActor/worktree validation. Keep actual bounded model-free provider process observation in lifecycle and closeout tests.

## Deviations From Plan Or Spec

- No trusted revision producer is added. BRC6a and BRC14 remain pending.
- Removed the unreferenced former campaign-acquisition fixture because it could only set up work through newly forbidden active admission. Its historical replacement cannot be used as active-producer evidence.

## Verification Rationale

The root-cause guard failed before the production change and passed afterward. Development checks cover new refusal, historical settlement/replay/rebind/closeout and unchanged shadow observation. The final contract also executes retained lower-level budget, retry, renewal, planning protection and process supervision suites; no local full suite is necessary. Remote required CI remains required.

Historical test corrections included canonical Lease target spelling (main) and using the complete task-cell suffix after the Sprint source prefix; neither changed product validation. Historical provider fixtures run model-free processes and do not invoke a provider service.

## Durable Entry

- docs/researches/20260907-brc6a-admission.md

## Open Boundaries

- Trusted revision producer and same-content old-revision readback falsifier.
- Existing independent classified_at reclaim issue; this package's crash-replay tests reuse the same observed classification timestamp.
- No real shadow canary, provider calls or release in this package.

## Publication evidence binding

> **Substantive Change SHA256**: `sha256:5ff571336c4331cc5d1e134932acffefeb3b52ac8042885eff892fd0bbcf8d3d`

PR #341 run 34109776761 stopped at task-sync before tests because the archived package lacked the publication diff binding. The same failure reproduced locally against base `8cf2af5b87e712a946449e6604feea3c67dbfe75`. This binding covers that base-to-publication substantive delta; adding it changes only this archived notes artifact. The 25/25 acceptance evidence and product subject remain unchanged. Both PR merge-base and main direct-parent task-sync modes validate the binding.
