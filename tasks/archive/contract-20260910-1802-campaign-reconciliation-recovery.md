## Why

Malformed reconciliation input currently leaves an immutable decision that cannot be consumed. An expired campaign cannot acknowledge a formal stop, blocking a quiescent continuation without preserving an operator exit.

## Goal

Reject invalid reconciliation input before publishing authority; recover an existing invalid evidence record once through a hash-bound operator command while retaining all original bytes and charge semantics; permit an explicit expired-to-stopped acknowledgment without reopening execution.

## Scope

- In scope: budget reconciliation preparation, audited evidence repair, terminal projection preservation, expired-to-stopped campaign event, focused regression tests and an operator runbook.
- Out of scope: live canary/grant/reservation writes during development; Oracle/browser changes; provider calls; new grants/Issues; worker/verifier reruns; deploy/release.
- Keep immutable original records, the existing continuation gate, and manual live source activation boundaries.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

If malformed input can already be corrected through an ordinary exact replay without changing immutable authority, or stop after expiry can reopen provider work, this design is wrong. Real-store RED tests and the terminal-transition matrix are the first proof points.

## Root Cause Evidence

- root_cause: budget-store.ts reconcileAutomationReservation publishes the immutable reconciliation before commitUsage seals/validates evidence; commitUsage also clears an existing exhaustion receipt from its next projection. development-campaign.ts excludes authorization_expired from stop without a terminal acknowledgment path.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Source baseline: 3c570360. Existing live stores remain untouched during implementation.
- Isolated research already reproduced the malformed-record deadlock; canonical RED evidence was captured on this worktree before production edits.
- Named accounting, campaign and CLI fixtures cover the changed boundaries; no local full-suite requirement. CI remains a separate source activation boundary.
- No dependencies are added. The repair receipt is an exceptional audit record, not a parallel charge authority; usage events remain the single accounting authority.

## Rollback Point

- Baseline: 3c570360.
- Revert source changes before activation. After an operator repair, original records and the new charge/repair receipt are retained; rollback never refunds or deletes ledger history.
