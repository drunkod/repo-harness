## Why

A lost preparation can leave an independent probe without a durable invocation, while no-start recovery incorrectly declares inactivity.

## Goal

Find the original pre-create journal from exact Claim identity, reconcile after its deadline without recreating work, and refuse reclaim absent protected preparation inactivity.

## Scope

- In scope: container/runtime/worker/recovery preparation, actual consumers, regression tests and evidence.
- Out of scope: active enablement, model calls, grants, retention cleanup, merge and package release.
- Taste constraints: <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

A pending preparation classified reclaimable, a repeated create/start during recovery, or a changed Claim consuming another journal falsifies this change.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: campaign-recovery.ts observe treats !started as inactive after retire without checking pending preparation.
- repro: bun test tests/effects/brc10-lifecycle.test.ts -t 'preparation without protected'
- regression_guard: tests/effects/brc10-lifecycle.test.ts
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: tasks/evidence/20260908-brc354-preparation-before.log

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/archive/plan-20260908-1826-brc354-preparation-recovery.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260908-1847-brc354-preparation-recovery.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/archive/notes-20260908-1847-brc354-preparation-recovery.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Change Assessment

## Exit Criteria (Machine Verifiable)

This block contains only non-executable artifact requirements. Define every
executable check once in the canonical Verification Plan below. Each check must
state its phase, cost, evidence policy, necessity, and input environment; a
missing or malformed plan fails closed.

```yaml
exit_criteria:
  files_exist:
    - src/effects/automation/campaign-container.ts
    - tasks/evidence/20260908-brc354-preparation-before.log
  artifacts_exist:
    - .ai/harness/checks/latest.json
    - tasks/archive/notes-20260908-1847-brc354-preparation-recovery.md
```

This is the sole executable verification authority. Use `baseline_with_delta`
only when a referenced immutable baseline plus named current delta checks prove
the intended coverage; do not infer that choice from paths or command text.
