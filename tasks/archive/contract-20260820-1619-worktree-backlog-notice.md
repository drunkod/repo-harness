## Why

Issue #196 reported 100+ accumulated worktree directories. Four merged fixes
made the cleanup path actually work; none of them tell anyone there is something
to clean. The reporter's own framing was that an automatic suggestion asking for
authorization would be the better experience, and that is the part still
unbuilt.

Deletion stays operator-executed. A worktree can hold unpushed work, removal is
irreversible, and a scheduled job cannot judge whether the contents matter. What
is automatable is noticing.

## Goal

SessionStart emits a section naming the contract worktrees that are cleanable
and the command that clears them, stays completely silent when there are none,
and deletes nothing.

## Scope

- In scope: add a `--target <ref>` batch entrypoint to
  `scripts/worktree-merge-lib.sh` behind a `BASH_SOURCE`/`$0` guard, printing
  one `<branch>\t<mode>` line per input branch; add
  `worktreeBacklogSessionSection(repoRoot)` to `src/cli/hook/session-context.ts`
  and register it in `buildSessionStartSections` (`:1391`) after
  `securitySentinelSessionSection`; add tests for the listed, silent, unmerged,
  and over-cap cases.
- Out of scope: any deletion, any prompt that performs deletion, any
  hook-initiated cleanup. The predicate inside `worktree_merge_mode`. Both
  existing consumers (`contract-worktree.sh`, `ship-worktrees.sh`). The
  dirty-worktree guards. Any new CLI command or flag — the section points at
  commands that already exist. Any other hook event.
- Taste constraints: mirror the shape of `minimalChangeSessionSection` and
  `securitySentinelSessionSection` in the same file — takes the repo root,
  returns a section or null. Do not introduce a new section abstraction, a
  config knob, or a caching layer.

## Authority constraint (the point of this slice)

The merge determination has exactly one implementation as of `b456121a`:
`worktree_merge_mode` in `scripts/worktree-merge-lib.sh`. **Do not re-derive it
in TypeScript.** Running `git merge-tree --write-tree` and comparing against
`<target>^{tree}` from `session-context.ts` would recreate the two-authority
defect that fix removed — the same datum decided in two places, drifting the
moment either side changes. That defect is what issue #196 actually was.

Consume the shell authority through the new batch entrypoint. Batch, not
per-branch: one process spawn for the whole scan.

Also rejected, do not implement: parsing
`ship-worktrees --cleanup-merged --dry-run` output. It couples a hook to a
human-readable format with no stability contract, and `run_cmd` echoes rather
than executes under `--dry-run`, so the mode never appears there at all.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.
- Stop if delivering the section would require re-implementing the merge
  determination outside `scripts/worktree-merge-lib.sh`.
- Stop if adding the entrypoint changes what sourcing the lib does. Sourcing
  must stay side-effect free.

## Scan bound

Cap the scan at 24 worktrees. The scan costs two things per worktree, not one:
a `merge-tree` classification for every scanned worktree (~22ms), and a
`git status --porcelain=v1 --untracked-files=all` cleanliness read for every
worktree that classification proves merged. End-to-end measurement of
`worktreeBacklogSessionContent` over a 25-worktree x 2555-file fixture puts the
cold ceiling near **1.9s** (1945ms cold, ~600ms warm). Twenty-four distinct
worktrees each pay their own cold index/lstat pass rather than sharing a warm
cache, so a per-call figure taken from one warm worktree understates the
aggregate by roughly 40%. Quote the cold number.

This section previously read "bounding the scan near 0.5s", derived from
`merge-tree` alone before the cleanliness read existed. The delivery falsified
the premise, not merely the arithmetic. The cap stays 24: the reasons for it
hold at 1.9s as they did at 0.5s. If that ceiling becomes unacceptable, the
lever is a lower cap, not dropping the cleanliness split.

Above the cap, state the unchecked count explicitly and point at
`ship-worktrees --cleanup-merged --dry-run` for the full list. Do not truncate
silently.

## Falsifier

If the section lists a worktree that `contract-worktree cleanup` would refuse,
the notice is worse than silence: it trains the operator to run a cleanup that
fails, and the habit formed after that is reaching for
`--discard-scaffold-only`.

Proof: build a **squash-absorbed and dirty** contract worktree and assert it is
absent from the cleanable list, while a clean merged sibling stays listed.
Merge state must be identical to the cleanable case so that working-tree state
is the only difference.

This section previously proposed a dirty **and unmerged** worktree as the
cheapest proof. That fixture is not discriminating: `unmerged` excludes it on
its own, leaving the dirtiness dimension inert, so the test passes against an
implementation that ignores dirtiness entirely. It also understated the stake.
A dirty merged worktree is not one refused row —
`guard_dirty_merged_worktree ... || exit 1` (`scripts/ship-worktrees.sh:1146`)
runs before the `DRY_RUN` branch and aborts the whole batch, so the
recommended `--dry-run` fails too and every worktree registered after it is
never reached. That is the accumulation dynamic of issue #196 itself.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).
