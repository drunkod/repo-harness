## Why

Native Windows cannot create canonical Task Inbox recipient paths. Reader stage acceptance is blocked; a path-only fixture workaround would disagree with the persistence authority.

## Goal

Deliver one portable v2 storage layout plus explicit offline byte-preserving migration, recovery and guarded rollback; preserve all original semantic identity and authorization.

## Scope

- In scope: the approved migration design, all Task Inbox path consumers, offline CLI, native fixtures and exact-boundary verification; integration of the owner-accepted Windows authority persistence dependency #444 at daa05cbf. Its exact inherited source/test and archived evidence paths are listed below.
- Out of scope: real data migration, architecture-queue, main merge, global installation, Host admission and homepage features.
- Taste constraints: <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

A canonical record digest changes during migration, an old layout appears as empty history, or native delivery/ACK/reply cannot use the new paths.

## Root Cause Evidence

- root_cause: src/effects/fleet/task-inbox.ts embeds the colon-bearing semantic recipient key directly in delivery and reply filesystem components, rejected by Windows.
- repro: native Windows CI35710331815; local portable-component regression in the existing effects suite.
- regression_guard: tests/effects/task-inbox.test.ts
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: .ai/harness/runs/task-inbox-portable-paths/before.log

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/archive/plan-20260922-1754-task-inbox-portable-paths.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260923-0253-task-inbox-portable-paths.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/archive/notes-20260923-0253-task-inbox-portable-paths.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Exit Criteria (Machine Verifiable)

This block contains only non-executable artifact requirements. Define every
executable check once in the canonical Verification Plan below. Each check must
state its phase, cost, evidence policy, necessity, and input environment; a
missing or malformed plan fails closed. Populate artifact requirements only
for deliverables this task actually owns; do not create a spec, notes or report
merely to fill this template.

```yaml
exit_criteria:
  files_exist:
    - src/core/fleet/task-inbox-layout.ts
    - src/effects/fleet/task-inbox-layout-migration.ts
    - deploy/task-inbox-layout-v2.md
  artifacts_exist:
    - .ai/harness/runs/task-inbox-portable-paths/before.log

Author the actual checks using [Testing Policy and Artifact Standards](../../docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md#testing-policy-and-artifact-standards).
The empty array is not permission to omit required repository checks: retain it
only when no executable criterion applies and explain why in Acceptance Notes.
Prefer existing covering tests; creating a task-named test or adding typecheck
is not a template requirement. For each selected check declare `id`, `kind`,
`cwd`, `phase`, `cost`, `evidence_policy`, `necessity`, `inputs.env`, and its
`command` or `path`. Declare the same execution once, including checks nested
inside aggregate scripts. Use `baseline_with_delta` only with an immutable
baseline and named current delta checks; never infer it from paths or command text.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

Existing inbox/reply/reader suites own behavior; one new effects suite owns the independently meaningful migration recovery boundary. Native CI is required for filesystem behavior. No local full suite is requested. All real-data operations are excluded; migration runs only in disposable fixtures. See the plan and research for byte preservation, refusal and offline rollout conditions.

The runtime_readback oracle is owner-7: it invokes the real candidate CLI in a disposable Git repository, reads back migrated record bytes and receipts, kills an actual child at retirement, resumes from retained state and verifies rollback refusal after a new write. Owner-5 additionally exercises production HTTP GETs under ready, legacy and migration layouts. These are local candidate runtime observations, not global installation, real-data migration or Host admission evidence.

## Rollback Point

- Base12518117e610007b34b9d10c94b5d92404a09ae3. Revert code before real migration; data rollback requires unchanged migrated output and explicit offline invocation.
