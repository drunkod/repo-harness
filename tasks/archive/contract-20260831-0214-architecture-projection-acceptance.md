## Why

`ProjectionRequestV1.acceptedChange` is the only protocol input that resolves a
major architecture delta, but no production CLI caller supplies it. Operators
currently need an untracked throwaway script, while the durable drain discards
the structured refresh signal into an opaque dead-letter message. A wrong
implementation could accept a different delta, reuse stale evidence, or let the
strict architecture gate pass without a content-bound receipt.

## Goal

Deliver one fail-closed manual `architecture-projection accept` command that
binds an explicit approval reference to the exact reasons, node ids, repository
identity, and worktree snapshot in a persisted unresolved-major refresh signal;
runs the existing ArchContext apply boundary; and writes an idempotent receipt
that the strict architecture gate validates.

Also close the proven proof-refresh lifecycle gap with a distinct fail-closed
reconciliation receipt. Reconciliation may retire only a proof-only candidate after
the current provider returns a CodeGraph-ready empty `noop` in check mode; it must
never carry an accepted change or apply receipt.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - Persist exact unresolved-major candidates from direct CLI and durable drain paths.
  - Add `accept --signal-id <sha256> --approval-reference <event-id> --json`.
  - Refuse malformed, mismatched, or stale candidates before provider execution.
  - Copy reason/node identity only from the signal, preserve approval identity exactly,
    consume canonical refresh actions, and atomically record reproducible evidence.
  - Teach the strict gate to resolve a candidate only through a matching valid receipt.
  - Add `reconcile --signal-id <sha256> --json` for an exact
    `verified-flow-proof-changed` candidate and validate current deterministic proof.
  - Persist a separate, reproducible reconciliation receipt and let the strict gate
    resolve the candidate through exactly one valid resolution kind.
  - Serialize the full resolution effect and close an automatic-drain dead letter
    through an exact terminal job receipt when reconciliation succeeds.
  - Add focused regression tests and synchronize source/template workflow surfaces.
- Out of scope:
  - collaboration runtime and R1 Agent Runtime worktree.
  - Automatic architecture acceptance, semantic inference, compatibility aliases,
    and historical rewriting of earlier C1/C3 acceptance records.
  - Reconciliation of semantic change reasons, provider apply, inferred proof, or use
    of a human approval reference as verification evidence.
- Taste constraints: one authority per datum; invalid states fail closed rather than being inferred.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

If the ArchContext refresh signal lacks sufficient repository/worktree identity
or resulting projection digest to derive and stale-check the accepted-change
reference, persisting that signal cannot form a safe CLI authority. The cheapest
proof is the focused fixture test against `ArchitectureRefreshSignalV1` before
wiring Commander or the shell gate.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: exact signal-bound manual acceptance and durable gate evidence.
- Edge cases: missing signal, mismatched approval retry, stale snapshot, provider/refresh failure,
  semantic candidate reconciliation, unavailable proof, non-noop reconciliation,
  and conflicting resolution receipts.
- Regression risks: gate/source-template drift and durable drain acknowledgement semantics.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: exact branch diff on `codex/architecture-projection-acceptance`.
- Revert strategy: revert CLI, acceptance store/orchestrator, gate mirror, tests, and workflow artifacts as one unit.
