## Design Decisions

- The user authorized owner acceptance and PR merge for BRC10-15 and explicitly directed this session to resume its own implementation work. Architecture ownership acceptance uses that existing task authorization; generated architecture documents are deterministic outputs of the new protected source mapping.

- Register the invocation, worker fence and recovery sources with the existing protected development-campaign capability. The generic automation include would not supply campaign self-protection; the existing inventory already protects this capability, so it needs no duplicate path list.

- Persist the exact eligibility receipt JSON bytes inside the planning intent; canonicalizing the nested signed object changes its owning digest preimage. The existing receipt validator remains unchanged.

## Deviations From Plan Or Spec

- Added supervised pipe digests after tracing the writable-log trust boundary; raw log contents alone cannot establish provider output.

## Tradeoffs Considered

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Reuse generic controller lifecycle | Rejected | Campaign dispatch never owned that generic controller record. |
| Reuse read-only delegation for a writable child | Rejected | The capability cannot be widened by a flag. |
| Existing supervisor plus tracked Codex role profiles | Selected | Reuses process-group control and binds the actual invocation. |

## Open Questions

- Final semantic acceptance and PR/main CI are pending. Managed invocation evidence does not prove arbitrary remote effects or Windows process-group absence.

## Bounded Terminal Event Correction

- Root cause: the sole JSONL parser skipped every non-item top-level event, silently dropping unknown remote operations from terminal evidence. A concrete `remote.operation.started` stream reproduced the false successful result (`/tmp/brc10-unknown-event-red.log`).
- Correction: skip only the three known lifecycle metadata events and reject unknown events. No second parser or inferred Provider status is added.
- Baseline: `16aaf754`, canonical run `run-20260907T114556-51253`, all 12 executable checks passed; Change Assessment remained blocked by the missing oracle declaration. Retain recovery execution `vx-30d89249e7a840568529` and affected execution `vx-18bd3ecbd8b24c09a7dc` as historical baselines. Current named parser/typed-process delta and integrity checks supply final-subject coverage.

## Evidence Links

- Durable design and file rationale: `docs/researches/20260907-brc10-lifecycle.md`
- Development checks: 40 provider/collector tests, 51 campaign-worker/runner tests, and the initial seven-case recovery matrix passed on their respective development subjects. Final acceptance must consume the frozen current subject.
- Checks: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`

## Promotion Filter

Promote a candidate to `tasks/lessons.md`, `docs/researches/`, or harness asset files only when all three hold: hard to reverse, surprising without local context, and a real trade-off existed. If any one is missing, keep it in this notes file instead.

## Promotion Candidates

- Promote to `tasks/lessons.md` only after a repeated correction or failure pattern.
- Promote to `docs/researches/` only when it is durable repo knowledge with evidence.
- Promote to harness asset files only after verification across more than one task or fixture.

## External Review and Descendant Correction

- One official Codex plugin review of subject `sha256:41ce0468ace003429792f3b3f7db462500e9b9027abbcfc7968addf154059567` returned P1/FAIL. The typed reject receipt preserves that result. No second external review was requested.
- Root cause: a command can redirect output and start a detached descendant outside the original process group. Provider turn completion plus group quiescence therefore cannot establish writable-effect inactivity.
- Red evidence: `/tmp/brc10-detached-red.log` runs a real detached subprocess, observes writes after the Provider exits, then shows the observer incorrectly returning true.
- Correction: persist Provider completion separately from `runtime_effect_inactive`; any command execution leaves inactivity unknown, and the reclaim consumer explicitly requires true. Normal execution and explicit verifier results remain usable. No descendant scanner or inferred containment is added.
- Remaining boundary: automatic reclaim after arbitrary commands requires actual descendant containment; this package deliberately refuses it. Never-started and fully observed no-command invocations retain recovery.
- Owner acceptance is delegated by the existing user instruction authorizing acceptance and PR merge for BRC10-15. Final acceptance must be recorded as owner/user waiver after correction verification, never as an external pass for changed bytes.

## Publication Evidence

> **Substantive Change SHA256**: `sha256:a503eff8c1b91f02830b94c56a044fb41a97eee817df92c1366b624ac8892f88`

This binds the complete publication diff from main `a3fb4db2b9f411d6e7bc5184807275e9aa471378`, including the final descendant-containment refusal and canonical architecture outputs. Canonical prepare `run-20260907T121057-48167` passed 19/19 and canonical finish completed. The original external P1 remains preserved; final acceptance uses the delegated owner receipt.
