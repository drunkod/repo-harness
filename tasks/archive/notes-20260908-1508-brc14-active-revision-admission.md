## Design Decisions

The existing history decoder owns revision semantics; strict protocol2 observations bind that evidence to the anchored initial campaign grant and original budget. No historical result is upgraded.

Fleet offer projection is also an active caller. Its guard must not repair budget projections, so readAutomationUsageForResult has explicit read_only mode reusing identical stored-reservation/event validation without the mutation lock or repair. Original settlement/recovery callers preserve their locked behavior.

An initial test assumed consuming the last provider allowance immediately changes budget state; the existing ledger only marks exhaustion at the next denied admission. The regression now exercises the actual denied reservation before checking stopped-budget refusal; the gate does not introduce another budget counter authority.

23 observation/identity/recovery tests and TypeScript passed before final acceptance.

## Open Questions

- None.

## Evidence Links

- Checks: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`

## Promotion Filter

Promote a candidate to `tasks/lessons.md`, `docs/researches/`, or harness asset files only when all three hold: hard to reverse, surprising without local context, and a real trade-off existed. If any one is missing, keep it in this notes file instead.

## Promotion Candidates

- Promote to `tasks/lessons.md` only after a repeated correction or failure pattern.
- Promote to `docs/researches/` only when it is durable repo knowledge with evidence.
- Promote to harness asset files only after verification across more than one task or fixture.

## Review correction

Architecture review identified budget deadline expiry without a stop receipt. The original guard relied on the active projection, which does not materialize elapsed deadlines. /tmp/brc14-deadline-red.log proves the prior implementation accepted that state. The guard now checks grant expiry and budget deadline with one current timestamp. The regression runs without a live provider. The previous untracked recovery-only handoff was moved to ignored .ai/harness/runs/ so it remains available without entering the commit surface.

## Final acceptance

Canonical run run-20260908T145745-40710 passed 13/13 criteria on source 744f49c3, including the focused caller/observation/transaction tests (202408 ms), typecheck and six integrity checks. Architecture/composition, security/assumption and cascade/abuse native reviews passed; deadline finding independently closed after its red/green guard. No live provider ran. Main independently advanced to cfb26baa and preserved its previous WIP; this isolated package does not merge or overwrite it.
