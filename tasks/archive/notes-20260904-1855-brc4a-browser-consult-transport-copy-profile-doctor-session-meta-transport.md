## Design Decisions

- **Capability detection needed no new probe shape.** `--copy-profile` is printed by
  `oracle --help`, `--browser-chrome-profile` only by `oracle --debug-help` (it is
  `hideHelp()` in the Oracle CLI). `probeOracle` already concatenates stdout and stderr of
  both invocations into one `helpText`, so a plain `helpText.includes(flag)` sees both. No
  parser probe in the style of `probeBrowserThinkingTime` and no version-number inference
  was needed. Verified on the pinned host binary: `oracle --help | grep -c copy-profile` = 1,
  `oracle --debug-help | grep -c browser-chrome-profile` = 1, and the inverse greps are 0.
- **The bound-profile path probes the binary before every real consult.** The capability
  gate calls `probeOracle` lazily and shares the result with the existing `--chatgpt-app`
  gate, so a bound consult costs one extra `--help`/`--debug-help`/parser-probe round rather
  than two. Cost accepted: without it there is no fail-closed signal for
  `ORACLE_COPY_PROFILE_UNSUPPORTED`.
- **Missing `profileDirectory` is a hard failure, not a degraded mode.** Oracle would fall
  back to the `Local State` `last_used` profile, which depends on whatever the user last
  opened in Chrome. That is exactly the class of silent, unattributable session the transport
  change is meant to remove, so `validateOracleProfileBinding` rejects it.
- **`browserCookiePath` stays in the doctor capability map and in the readiness set.** The
  acceptance line adds two capabilities and retires none. The Codex review argued that
  readiness should no longer depend on a flag the wrapper never sends; that is a real
  observation, but dropping a capability from the readiness set loosens the gate in the same
  change that tightens it, and no acceptance clause asks for it. Left as is and reported as
  a follow-up candidate.
- **Oracle's `--copy-profile` mutual exclusions need no defensive code.** Oracle rejects
  `--copy-profile` together with `--browser-manual-login`, `--browser-keep-browser`,
  `--remote-chrome`, and `--remote-host`. `buildOracleCommand` emits none of those four on
  any path, so there is nothing to guard; the constraint is documented in
  `docs/repo-harness-chatgpt-browser-engine.md` instead.
- **The dry run fails closed on an unusable binding instead of previewing half a
  transport.** First pass let `--dry-run` render a lone `--copy-profile` when the binding
  named no profile directory, on the theory that the preview should mirror the argv. The
  Codex acceptance review rejected that: the previewed command is evidence, and a command
  the real run refuses is not a useful preview. `runBrowserConsult` now runs
  `validateOracleProfileBinding` on the oracle dry-run path too and returns the same
  `ORACLE_PROFILE_NOT_FOUND`, so there is one rule for both paths.
- **`browser.transport` is derived from the profile binding only, per the dispatched
  design.** A native-provider session with a binding therefore records `copy_profile` even
  though the deprecated native path drives the user's own Chrome over CDP rather than
  copying it. The Codex review flagged this; changing it means either a third transport
  value or a provider-dependent rule, both of which change the type this task was handed.
  Left as dispatched and reported upward instead.

## Deviations From Plan Or Spec

- The dispatch expected `repo-harness chatgpt browser-doctor --provider oracle --json` to
  report `ready` on this machine with Oracle 0.18.0. It reports `action_required` /
  `ORACLE_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED` because `REQUIRED_ORACLE_VERSION` is still pinned to
  `0.14.1`. The two new capabilities do probe `true` against the 0.18.0 binary, which is the
  part this contract owns. Bumping the version pin is not in the BRC4a acceptance line and
  is left untouched.
- The dispatch's precheck design named only `ORACLE_PROFILE_NOT_FOUND`; the sprint
  acceptance line also requires `ORACLE_COPY_PROFILE_UNSUPPORTED`. Both are implemented,
  capability gate first (binary compatibility) and binding gate second (local
  configuration).

## Tradeoffs Considered

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Keep `--browser-cookie-path` as a fallback when `--copy-profile` is unavailable | Rejected | Two transports keep the silent anonymous-login failure reachable and make the failure untestable |
| Detect the running-session refusal by exit code | Rejected | Oracle exits 1 for many reasons; the verbatim message is the only specific signal |
| Auto-append `--force` on `ORACLE_SESSION_ALREADY_RUNNING` | Rejected | It would abandon a live detached worker and its browser; reattach or cleanup is the user's call |
| Bump `REQUIRED_ORACLE_VERSION` to 0.18.0 so the local doctor turns green | Deferred | Version pinning is its own compatibility surface and is not in this acceptance line |

## Review Rounds

- Round 1 (`codex exec -s read-only`, branch diff against `main@d8d62dea`): `REJECT`, six
  findings. Fixed in place: the dry-run half transport, single-missing-flag coverage for
  `ORACLE_COPY_PROFILE_UNSUPPORTED`, and a fixture-level assertion that the refused
  same-prompt run is invoked exactly once and never with `--force`. Kept with rationale: the
  `browserCookiePath` readiness entry and the binding-derived `transport` value. The sprint
  row 4 checkbox commit is a coordinator-requested conflict-avoidance commit, kept separate.
- Round 2 (same subject, round 1 fixes applied): `PASS`, no findings.
- Round 3 (after rebasing onto `main@b62e6a07`, which landed PR #289): `PASS`, no findings.
  The rebase conflicted only on `docs/architecture/.projection-manifest.json` and
  `tasks/todos.md`; both took the main version, the manifest was then regenerated with
  `repo-harness architecture-projection drain` rather than hand-edited, and the commit that
  had only refreshed the manifest became empty and was skipped. `.ai/harness/worktrees/<slug>.json`
  still recorded the pre-rebase `base_commit`, which fails the gate with
  `stale_base_commit`; refreshing that ignored runtime file to the new fork point is the
  documented remedy.

## Open Questions

- `REQUIRED_ORACLE_VERSION` is pinned at `0.14.1` while the transport this contract
  introduces was measured on 0.18.0. Any real GPT Pro consult on this machine stays blocked
  by the version gate until that pin is revisited in its own work-package.

## Evidence Links

- Checks: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`

## Promotion Filter

Promote a candidate to `tasks/lessons.md`, `docs/researches/`, or harness asset files only when all three hold: hard to reverse, surprising without local context, and a real trade-off existed. If any one is missing, keep it in this notes file instead.

## Promotion Candidates

- Promote to `tasks/lessons.md` only after a repeated correction or failure pattern.
- Promote to `docs/researches/` only when it is durable repo knowledge with evidence.
- Promote to harness asset files only after verification across more than one task or fixture.
