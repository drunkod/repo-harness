## Human Review Card

- Verdict: independent reviewer approve, no findings.
- Change type: bugfix; missing integration inventory classification.
- P1/P2/P3 and root cause: captured plan and contract.
- Full PR subject: six semantic paths, including unchanged prior reply protocol.
- Rollback: revert inventory follow-up; no production state changes.

## Verification Evidence

- Canonical preparation: 25 criteria passed (13 executable checks), log `.ai/harness/runs/akn03-reply-protocol/inventory-prepare.log`. Final committed-authority preparation follows.
- Existing inventory regression: before 18 pass / 1 fail; after 19 pass. Reply/message tests remain passing.
- Independent reviewer sandbox could not resolve archctx-contracts for baseline; local canonical inventory check executed in the complete dependency environment and passed. This is separate evidence, not a claim that the reviewer ran it.
- Hosted Windows retry job 106447764221 passed on unchanged 4a8b2992. Root cause of original timeout remains unproven.

## Independent Review Transcript

```json
{
  "verdict": "approve",
  "summary": "No material blocker found in the scoped diff against the pinned base, including local changes. Reply and message protocol tests passed. Full baseline verification remains blocked by the missing archctx-contracts dependency.",
  "findings": [],
  "next_steps": [
    "Restore archctx-contracts and rerun tests/unit/collaboration-authority-baseline.test.ts."
  ]
}
```

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- PR #436 repairs separate baseline candidate-runtime fixture failures; this branch does not contain that change.
- Protocol completeness proves structural integrity only. Protected persistence, MCP, and real Host acceptance remain unfinished AKN-03 work.
- Hosted CI for final pushed head remains to run.

## Final-subject owner acceptance

After committing the source, automatic architecture projection updated only the `verifiedAgainst.commit` and `verifiedAgainst.committedAt` values for the inventory source. The final subject is `sha256:38bbf3fc3f6984b51595f57b06a41f5ed7a41f142f46a662c43136e860a7b55d` at `780d1bf6a365c991863e4bd1d3567eea80bd6453`; the prior external verdict belongs to the different subject recorded above. Final canonical verification passed all 25 criteria, with committed contract authority (run `run-20260922T015621-19491`).

A request to review the changed final subject returned `review_budget_exhausted` before provider invocation: this work-package has used its one semantic review and requires owner acceptance. The user explicitly approved the scoped final candidate on 2026-09-22. The official grant-waiver and record commands recorded a user_waiver AcceptanceReceipt for this exact final subject; the prior external verdict is not reused as acceptance of the new digest. Main merge, installation and Host admission remain outside this acceptance.

- Summary: User explicitly approved exact candidate 780d1bf6a365c991863e4bd1d3567eea80bd6453 and subject sha256:38bbf3fc3f6984b51595f57b06a41f5ed7a41f142f46a662c43136e860a7b55d after disclosure of the two-field architecture projection delta and review_budget_exhausted. Final 25 criteria passed. This owner acceptance does not authorize main merge, runtime installation, Host admission, or later stages.
- Findings: none
