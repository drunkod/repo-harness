## Why

repo-harness currently has no auditable ingress for external Issue facts. If provider state is mapped directly into TaskOffer, priority, Claim, Lease, collaboration, or Agent Runtime effects, GitHub becomes a second scheduler and bypasses the approved sprint/plan/contract authority chain. If refresh failure is collapsed into an empty backlog, operators cannot distinguish a healthy zero-Issue result from auth, rate-limit, pagination, or response-limit failure.

## Goal

Ship one reviewable P0 capability that performs an explicitly enabled, bounded, manual GitHub refresh; persists provider-neutral immutable Issue observations plus one immutable attempt receipt; derives a read-only projection; and exposes `external-source refresh/list` CLI commands while leaving every existing planning, Fleet, Claim/Lease, WorkEnvelope, collaboration, and Agent Runtime authority unchanged.

## Scope

- In scope: `ProviderIssueObservationV1`, `ExternalSourceRefreshReceiptV1`, and `ExternalSourceProjectionV1`; strict `external_sources` policy parsing with absent/off as the only default and exactly one label-scan or Issue-number selection mode; Git-common-dir create-once storage; bounded GitHub `gh` adapter; one-shot refresh/list CLI; initialization/config documentation required for the new key; architecture/workstream projection; focused protocol, policy, store, adapter, CLI, and authority tests.
- Out of scope: GitLab; webhooks; daemon/timer; MCP surface; UI; provider writeback; comments fetch; task adoption/binding; prompt rendering; fuzzy identity; migration/compatibility readers; mutable `seen/processing/done` state; any change to TaskOffer/acquire/Claim/Lease/WorkEnvelope/collaboration/runtime authority or semantics.
- Taste constraints: provider content remains inert untrusted JSON; immutable provider repository/Issue IDs own identity and display refs do not; every limit is explicit and positive; exact batches resolve only declared Issue numbers and fail if any member is unavailable; GitHub labels/assignees/state never infer local dispatch; incomplete/unavailable attempts are persisted and return non-zero; no semantic fallback, alias, inferred legacy shape, mutable cache, or speculative shared abstraction.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

Cheapest proof point: a deterministic two-page GitHub fixture containing an eligible Issue, an ineligible Issue, a PR-shaped item, prompt-injection body text, a later content revision, a complete empty refresh, and a 429 attempt. Stop and hand back if bounded observation cannot retain stable immutable provider repository/Issue IDs or cannot distinguish complete-empty from failure/incomplete pagination; the approved fallback is a separate explicit signed-file or single-Issue import design, not fuzzy matching or best-effort state.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: manual GitHub refresh writes immutable observations and one attempt receipt, then list derives a provider-neutral read-only projection; duplicate content is idempotent and content drift preserves history.
- Edge cases: PR filtering, complete empty, 403/429/network/invalid JSON, pagination/body/total-byte/deadline limits, repository rename/transfer, unsafe paths/symlinks, concurrent identical writes, conflicting bytes, and prompt-injection content.
- Regression risks: any write or semantic change under sprint/TaskOffer/Fleet/Claim/Lease/WorkEnvelope/collaboration/runtime stores is a release blocker; init policy drift and provider failure represented as a healthy empty result are release blockers.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: `5da19636221d2aaed21ed7be1545c2648a204265` before the P0 worktree branch.
- Revert strategy: revert the single `codex/external-source-intake-p0` merge unit. Preserve existing Git-common-dir external-source records as inert user evidence; no current authority reads them and rollback must not delete them.
