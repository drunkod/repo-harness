## Why

The collaboration dispatch fence is currently a call-site pre-step in `src/cli/commands/delegation.ts` and
`scripts/c9-collaboration-dispatch-runner.ts`. A non-CLI controller (agent task automation, MCP, a future
scheduler) that calls `dispatchDelegatedRun()` directly reaches the Codex host action with no live binding
check, so injected coordination context that no `CollaborationRunContextBindingV1` accounts for can reach a
Worker. "Every caller remembers a pre-step" is not a stable invariant and regresses silently the moment a
second production dispatch surface is added.

## Goal

`dispatchDelegatedRun()` in `src/effects/engineers/delegated-run-store.ts` enforces
`fenceCollaborationDispatch()` itself, inside the dispatch lock and before any state mutation or host action,
so no caller can reach the host action for a collaboration run without a live binding. `delegation_only` runs
still dispatch with no binding, refusal codes are unchanged, and the CLI and C9 pre-steps are deleted because
the effect now owns the edge.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - `src/effects/engineers/delegated-run-store.ts`: compose the fence into `dispatchDelegatedRun()`.
  - `src/cli/commands/delegation.ts`: delete the redundant pre-step and rename the handler to the dispatch verb it now is.
  - `scripts/c9-collaboration-dispatch-runner.ts`: delete the redundant pre-step.
  - `src/effects/collaboration/context-delivery.ts`: rewrite the fence ownership comments; no behavior change.
  - `tests/effects/collaboration-dispatch-effect-fence.test.ts` and `tests/effects/collaboration-dispatch-fence-composed.test.ts`: direct-effect and composed-path acceptance.
  - `.archcontext/model/` selectors and flows plus `docs/architecture/` projection: move the declared edge from the CLI adapter to the dispatch effect.
  - `tasks/todos.md`: delete the fulfilled deferred-goal row.
- Out of scope: a second dispatch implementation; inferring collaboration intent from a prompt; weakening binding revision, run identity or context-delivery checks; any fallback that dispatches after a fence error; task identity (`coordination-identity.ts`) and scheduling dependency authority (`scheduling.ts`), which sibling contracts own.
- Taste constraints: keep the single dispatch semantics; the fence is one call at the top of the locked section, not a new abstraction.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

The direction is wrong if the fence cannot run inside the dispatch effect without a second dispatch path or a
weakened check. Cheapest proof point first: `tests/effects/collaboration-dispatch-effect-fence.test.ts` — a
direct `dispatchDelegatedRun()` call for a collaboration run with no binding must fail with
`binding_missing`, leave the run at `intent_persisted`, and persist zero launch claims. If that call cannot be
refused from inside the effect, or if the delegation-only case starts requiring a binding, the composition is
wrong and the pre-step shape must stay.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).
