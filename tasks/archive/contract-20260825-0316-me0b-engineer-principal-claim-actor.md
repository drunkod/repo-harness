## Why

ME-0A can persist one current Module Engineer Binding, but every mutation caller can still self-report the Binding fields. Without a server-derived principal and claim provenance, a retired Session can replay stale identity and downstream scheduling/delegation would build on a false authorization boundary. Shipping the wrong carrier is worse than skipping the feature: reusing Provider Thread IDs, hook session IDs or the open-shell coding profile would label caller-controlled or locally mutable state as authentication.

## Goal

Deliver the Approved ME-0B boundary: an OAuth-only no-shell Engineer MCP profile, server-derived authorization principal mapped to and revalidated against the live ME-0A Binding, immutable ClaimActorReceipt publication, and engineer-scoped acquire that reuses canonical Fleet/Lease/WorkEnvelope effects and compensates only its own Claim when receipt persistence fails.

## Scope

- In scope: closed principal/mapping/receipt protocols；restricted Engineer MCP profile/scope/tool inventory；operator mapping enrollment/revocation/readback；live Binding revalidation；Fleet acquire wrapper；immutable receipt/live Lease validation；own-Claim compensation；focused E2E/security regression tests；architecture/workstream evidence。
- Out of scope: Provider Thread authentication；Codex/Claude adapters；Worker Host；Work Package Graph/EngineerOffer；delegation/messaging/writer grant/handoff/Human Board；Task/Lease/WorkEnvelope/Publication/Acceptance schema changes；generic CLI engineer acquire；bearer-token CLI fields；worktree deletion on failure。
- Taste constraints: one authority per datum；exact-key schemas；no fallback identity；no coding-shell reuse；command identity fields are fences only；keep generic Fleet behavior unchanged。

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

The direction is wrong if the existing OAuth boundary cannot provide a stable server-derived authorization ID without also granting coding shell, or if engineer acquire cannot compensate its exact returned Claim without changing Lease semantics. Cheapest proof: policy/OAuth/HTTP tool-inventory fixture plus an injected receipt-write failure over the existing Fleet dependency seam.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: exact OAuth subject → mapping → current Binding → Fleet Claim → immutable actor receipt path.
- Edge cases: cross-authorization hijack；revoked/stale mapping；rotated Binding；payload spoof；receipt idempotency/conflict；receipt failure after Fleet success；foreign Claim replacement；compensation failure。
- Regression risks: exhaustive MCP profile lists/config setup；OAuth scope/profile refresh；public tool inventory；generic Fleet acquire behavior。

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: one isolated `codex/me0b-engineer-principal-claim-actor` work-package.
- Revert strategy: revert new Engineer MCP/profile/principal/receipt/acquire modules and projections；existing Binding/Fleet/Lease data remains valid and unchanged。
