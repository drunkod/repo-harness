/**
 * Browser-facing view of one collaborative Work Exchange collection.
 *
 * The sibling of `projectOperatorFleetSnapshot()`, and it keeps the same rule:
 * the collaboration read model stays the authority for every semantic field, and
 * this transport view only removes what a browser must not receive. It
 * classifies nothing, recounts nothing and re-derives nothing — in particular it
 * does not compute a hotspot, does not decide whether a handoff is open, and
 * does not re-run the read-time succession proof, all of which are already
 * decided upstream.
 *
 * Three fields are deliberately absent from the output.
 *
 * `execution_offers` is absent because the board is not an Engineer. Offer
 * eligibility needs an `EngineerPrincipalV1`, and `collectCollaborativeWorkExchange()`
 * requires an offer reader precisely so that an empty list cannot be read as "there
 * is nothing to pick up" when the real fact is "nobody asked". The operator read
 * asks on nobody's behalf, so publishing a list here — empty or otherwise — would
 * be the board answering a question it never put. Delivery-plane availability is
 * already on the board through the Fleet worklist.
 *
 * `snapshot_sha256` is absent for the same reason: it is the digest of a document
 * that contains that unasked-for offer list, so two readers looking at identical
 * store contents through different callers would disagree about it.
 * `source_snapshot_sha256` — the identity of the signal set every projection was
 * derived from — is carried instead, exactly as the Fleet projection carries the
 * source digest rather than a digest of the redacted document.
 *
 * A handoff's `execution_context` is reduced to its discriminant. C6 already
 * applied verify-or-exclude, so a surviving `bound_task` branch is proven; but a
 * proven branch still names a Claim id, a lease generation and a freeze receipt
 * digest, none of which a browser has any use for. What a reader needs is what
 * kind of work the knowledge came from, and whether a context was withheld.
 */
/**
 * The source plane's protocol, carried rather than minted.
 *
 * The Fleet transport view does the same thing for the same reason: this
 * document is a redaction of a collaboration read model, not a second wire
 * identity with a version axis of its own, and a reader correlating the two
 * needs the number to mean the same thing on both sides. It is restated as a
 * literal because importing the collaboration constant would pull that module's
 * Node `createHash` dependency into the browser bundle; the annotation is the
 * source protocol's own type, so a bump that forgets this file fails typecheck.
