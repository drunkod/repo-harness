/**
 * Pure board projection: collected board inputs -> one `BoardDocumentV1`.
 *
 * Zero IO, zero clock, zero randomness. Identical input bytes yield
 * byte-identical JSON, which is what makes the A/B revision comparison in
 * `src/effects/state/resolve-board.ts` mean anything: if the document could
 * vary on its own, an unequal round would prove nothing about the inputs.
 *
 * Three dimensions, three authorities, never collapsed into one `status`:
 *
 * | dimension        | authority                        | may move work |
 * | ---------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- |
 * | `task_state`     | the canonical sprint row         | yes           |
 * | `lease_state`    | the owner record on the plane    | yes           |
 * | `progress_state` | the owner worktree's ledger      | no            |
 *
 * Column decision table, first match wins (`done > blocked > doing > todo`):
 *
 * | # | Column  | Condition                                                        |
 * |---|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | 1 | done    | `task_state === 'done'` -- unconditional                          |
 * | 2 | blocked | lease `unknown` or `released`                                     |
 * | 3 | blocked | `task_state` `drifted` or `missing`                               |
 * | 4 | blocked | `progress_state === 'stalled'`                                    |
 * | 5 | blocked | the owner worktree left `git worktree list`                       |
 * | 6 | blocked | the owner record names a different canonical ref                  |
 * | 7 | doing   | lease `reserving`, `bound`, or `completing`                       |
 * | 8 | todo    | everything else (a pending row with no lease)                     |
 *
 * Row 1 is unconditional on purpose: the tracked `[x]` row is the completion
 * authority, and a residual lease on a completed row is cleanup, not work. It
 * carries `lease_cleanup_required` plus an executable `actions.reconcile`
 * instead of dragging the card back into `blocked`.
 *
 * Row 2 puts a residual `released` in `blocked` because it genuinely blocks:
 * `claimSprintCommand` refuses anything whose classification is not
 * `available`, so a `released` record whose directory removal never completed
 * is an unclaimable row, not a free one.
 *
 * `progress_state === 'unreadable'` is deliberately absent from the blocking
 * set. Evidence failure must never transfer or withhold ownership, so an
 * unreadable ledger yields a card whose `claim`, `lease_state`, and `column`
 * are field-for-field identical to the readable case.
