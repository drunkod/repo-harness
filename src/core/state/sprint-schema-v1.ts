/**
 * COMPATIBILITY SURFACE -- migration input only.
 *
 * This module is the single remaining implementation of the schema 1 task
 * identity derivation: `task_id = digest(protocol + repo identity + canonical
 * sprint path + exact Task cell text)`. It exists for exactly one reason, which
 * is to let `repo-harness sprint migrate-schema` write each row's *existing*
 * identity into the new persisted `ID` cell instead of inventing a new alias.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT reachable from `projectCanonicalTasks`, from any
 * claim, offer, board, message, or binding path, or from the shell helper. A
 * schema 1 sprint fails closed everywhere else; there is no dual-read window
 * during which a live sprint can mint identity from its Task text.
 *
 * Exactly one runtime verb may read it: `sprint reconcile`, through
 * `lookupLegacyTaskForReconcile()`. Reconcile is the recovery verb that has to
 * work *before* the migration, and without it the two rules deadlock -- the
 * migration refuses a non-released lease, while a lease minted under schema 1
 * can never be proved finished once identity is schema-2-only. That exception
 * is bounded to a `completing` residue over a completed row and dies with the
 * same `sprint-schema-v1-parser-removal` trigger as the rest of this module.
 *
 * - Compatibility owner: the repo-harness coordination-identity maintainer,
 *   tracked as the `sprint-schema-v1-parser-removal` deferred-goal row in
 *   `tasks/todos.md`.
 * - Removal trigger: once every tracked sprint under `plans/sprints/` reports
 *   `Backlog Schema: 2` and no archived sprint needs re-activation, delete this
 *   module together with `sprint migrate-schema` and the schema 1 branches in
 *   `sprint-backlog-rows.ts` and `scripts/sprint-backlog.sh`.
