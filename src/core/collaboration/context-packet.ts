/**
 * `CollaborationContextPacketV1` — bounded, reproducible context for one reader.
 *
 * Sprint row C2. The packet answers one question: given a subject and a set of
 * committed signals, which handful is worth spending a reader's context window
 * on, and why. Every part of that answer is derivable from the signal bytes.
 *
 * Three properties carry the row's acceptance line.
 *
 * There is no `built_at`. Delivery time belongs on the run-context binding and
 * the adoption receipt, not here: a wall-clock field inside `packet_sha256`
 * would mean the same store never rebuilds the same packet twice, and the field
 * is absent rather than merely excluded from the digest so there is nothing to
 * forget to exclude.
 *
 * `why_relevant` is a closed code plus the refs it hit, never prose. A reader
 * can check the claim; a sentence generated about why something matters is one
 * more thing to trust.
 *
 * The budget is split by a fixed quota before selection, not after. Filling by
 * pure relevance and hoping for variety puts the hottest lane in every slot,
 * which is the failure Child PRD A names: exploration gets its own budget, and
 * an unspent exploitation budget cannot be borrowed to buy more of the same
 * lane.
 *
 * The rendered text is wrapped in `[CoordinationContextUntrusted]`, the third
 * instance of the existing marker-plus-fixed-warning shape used by
 * `[TaskInboxUntrustedPeerMessages]` and `[ModuleInboxUntrustedPeerMessage]`.
 * The trust boundary is reused, not reinvented: these are observations, not
 * instructions, and the packet grants their authors nothing.
