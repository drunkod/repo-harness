/**
 * Threads, lanes and contribution opportunities, derived from committed signals.
 *
 * Sprint row C2. There is no central lane enum and no lane registry. A lane is
 * the set of signals whose `thread_key` is byte-for-byte equal; keys that merely
 * look alike stay apart, because the key is opaque to the system and a
 * similarity merge would be the system deciding what an agent meant.
 *
 * The projection is a pure function of the source signal bytes plus injected
 * structural facts. It opens no file, keeps no cache and reads no clock, so the
 * same set of signals projects to the same bytes on every rebuild. Child PRD A
 * rules out a `threads/<digest>/current.json` cache for P0 precisely so this
 * property has no second, staler answer to disagree with.
 *
 * Every number here is something a reader could count by hand from the records:
 * how many signals, how many distinct participants, how many artifact
 * references, how many edges leave the lane. Nothing infers state, intent or
 * mood from a body; the thin signal protocol carries no field that would support
 * it, and Child PRD A removes `open_request`, `unverified_hypothesis` and
 * `stalled_thread` from machine semantics for exactly that reason. Agents remain
 * free to say the same things with open labels the system gives no meaning.
