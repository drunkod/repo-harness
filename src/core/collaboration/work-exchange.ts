/**
 * `CollaborativeWorkExchangeSnapshotV1` — execution offers and collaboration
 * state in one read model.
 *
 * Sprint row C6. The snapshot answers "what could I pick up, who is already
 * here, and what have they said" with a single set of bytes, so an Agent does
 * not have to join five stores itself and reach five slightly different
 * conclusions about what the moment looked like.
 *
 * Three properties carry the row.
 *
 * Execution offers pass through untouched. An `EngineerOfferV1` arrives with its
 * own `offer_revision` and leaves with the same one; this module never rebuilds a
 * revision, never re-derives readiness, and never decides an offer is stale.
 * Offer eligibility is `src/core/engineers/scheduling.ts`'s authority and the
 * projection borrows none of it — the revision is surfaced beside the offer
 * purely so a reader can compare two snapshots without unpacking the record.
 *
 * `snapshot_consistency` is injected, exactly as the context packet's is. This
 * builder sees arrays that are already assembled and cannot observe whether they
 * were read from a store that moved underneath the collector, so it has no
 * honest way to derive the value. The reader in `src/effects/collaboration/`
 * supplies it; `stable` is a positive assertion about a double-read, and
 * defaulting to it here would seal a claim this layer cannot make into
 * `snapshot_sha256`.
 *
 * A `bound_task` execution context is proven or it is not shown. The proof
 * itself needs the Task freeze store, which is an effect, so the results arrive
 * through the same consumer-declared seam pattern: the builder requires a proof
 * entry for every `bound_task` handoff in its input and refuses the whole
 * snapshot when one is missing. It is never inferred, never defaulted to
 * verified, and never defaulted to unverified either — a missing proof means the
 * caller did not run the check, which is a different fact from the check failing.
