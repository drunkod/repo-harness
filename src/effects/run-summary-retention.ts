/**
 * Retention for Stop's per-run summaries under the policy `harness.runs_dir`.
 *
 * `src/cli/hook/stop-handler.ts` writes one `${runId}.json` per Stop and, until
 * this module existed, nothing ever removed it. Its sibling
 * `hook-event-log.ts` already bounds the other unbounded file in the same
 * directory (the rotated hook telemetry log); this bounds the summaries.
 *
 * The bound is a count, not a byte budget: summaries are fixed-shape ~4 KB
 * records, so "how many runs of history" is the honest unit, and it mirrors
 * `HOOK_LOG_ARCHIVE_SEGMENTS` rather than adding a policy surface no second
 * consumer has asked for.
 *
 * The non-obvious rule is which files the count applies to. Several writers
 * share this directory, and two of them produce durable evidence that a
 * filename rule cannot tell apart from Stop churn:
 *
 * - `stop-handler.ts` and `workflow_write_run_summary` in
 *   `assets/hooks/lib/workflow-state.sh` both write `${runId}.json` in the same
 *   shape -- disposable session history. The shell writer is the larger
 *   producer by volume and supplies the free-form `reason` values.
 * - `scripts/verify-sprint.sh` freezes an acceptance snapshot whose exact path a
 *   checks projection records in `.run_file` and reads back at finalization.
 *   Its `runId` prefix is the same as Stop's.
 * - `evidence/verification-execution.ts` writes an immutable
 *   `verification-${executionId}.json` that the evidence ledger binds by
 *   sha256; `readValidRunResult` treats a missing file as an absent baseline,
 *   which fails a `baseline_with_delta` criterion permanently, because a rerun
 *   only ever mints a new execution id.
 *
 * Deleting either evidence class strands an acceptance with no operator exit, so
 * this sweep never reasons about what to keep. It deletes only files whose
 * content is the run-summary record `stop-handler.ts` itself writes: a `run_id`
 * plus the four resolved projection paths. Every field in that record is a
 * pointer recomputed from live policy on the next Stop, which is what makes the
 * record disposable; the other two shapes carry results. Anything else in the
 * directory -- including a shape a fourth writer adds later -- belongs to its
 * own owner and is left alone.
 *
 * The discriminator is the shape, not `reason`. `reason` is free-form operator
 * text (this repository's own history holds ~190 distinct values), so matching
 * on one value would leave every other run summary unreclaimable forever.
