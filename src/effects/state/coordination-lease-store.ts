/**
 * The coordination plane's filesystem primitives, rooted at
 * `$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/repo-harness/coordination/v1/`:
 *
 * ```
 * leases/<task-id>/owner.json
 * locks/tasks/<task-id>.lock/
 * locks/backlog.lock/
 * ```
 *
 * The git common directory is the point: it is shared by every linked worktree
 * of one clone, which is exactly the scope `sprint-backlog.sh`'s per-worktree
 * `in_flight_dir()` and `.backlog-lock` lack.
 * `scripts/contract-worktree.sh:513-537` already proves this shape here, with
 * one atomic `mkdir` election plus an owner record under the same common dir.
 *
 * Mutual exclusion reuses `withExclusiveDirectoryLock`, the house primitive
 * `src/effects/state/git-state-version-store.ts` already runs against this same
 * common directory. It is the same atomic-`mkdir` election with stale reclaim
 * that `acquire_backlog_lock()` performs, hardened with a published owner
 * token, PID liveness, and ancestor-identity checks; hand-rolling a second,
 * weaker mutex beside it would be a duplicate authority for the same datum.
 *
 * Nothing here classifies by guessing. A lease directory with no owner record
 * (the crash window between `mkdir` and the durable write), a malformed or
 * empty record, and a symlinked lease directory or record are all `unknown`,
 * and `unknown` is never silently deleted -- `removeLease` refuses to touch it.
