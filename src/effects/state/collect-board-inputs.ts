/**
 * Every side effect the board performs, in one place.
 *
 * Five reads, five authorities, and nothing else:
 *
 * 1. the canonical sprint at an explicit ref (`git show <commit>:<path>`),
 * 2. this sprint's leases on the shared plane, as raw owner bytes,
 * 3. `git worktree list --porcelain`, raw,
 * 4. each owner worktree's attempt ledger, raw,
 * 5. each owner worktree's `progress_token` via `resolveEffectiveStateReadOnly`.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT read: worktree metadata (WP4's surface; reading it
 * here would create exactly the dependency that relocation is supposed to be
 * free to move) and any task lock (the board is an observer, and an observer
 * that takes ownership locks would serialize every agent behind every reader).
 * The price of holding no lock is `changed_during_read`, which is a report,
 * not a failure.
 *
 * Leases are read for the task ids of THIS sprint only -- no directory scan.
 * A scan would pull another sprint's residue into this document and report it
 * as this sprint's anomaly, and the board's scope is one sprint by decision.
 *
 * Digests hash bytes, never parsed objects. Two owner records that parse
 * identically but were written by different owners at different moments are
 * precisely the torn read the coordination digest exists to expose; parsing
 * erases that difference before the comparison can see it.
