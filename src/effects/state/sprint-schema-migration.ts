/**
 * The one-shot sprint backlog schema 1 -> 2 migration verb.
 *
 * It is a migration, not a repair loop: it reads one canonical sprint at one
 * ref, derives every row's existing schema 1 identity, refuses anything it
 * cannot prove, writes the sprint and the same-commit Work Graph carrier, then
 * re-reads what it wrote and proves each persisted id equals the identity the
 * row already had. Any refusal leaves both files untouched.
 *
 * The order of the gates matters. Lease refusal comes before any write because
 * the contract forbids the migration from silently stealing, releasing, or
 * rewriting a live lease; the re-read proof comes after the write because a
 * proof over the in-memory string would only restate the rewrite, not verify
 * the bytes that landed.
