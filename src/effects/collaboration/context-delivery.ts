/**
 * Context delivery and the dispatch fence.
 *
 * Sprint row C6. This is the path a collaboration round's context actually
 * travels, and the check that refuses a run which took a different one:
 *
 * ```text
 * collect the exchange (double-read, honest consistency)
 *   -> build CollaborationContextPacketV1 over that exact collection
 *   -> render the canonical [CoordinationContextUntrusted] block
 *   -> compose it into the delegated run's goal
 *   -> record CollaborationRunContextBindingV1
 *   -> inside dispatch, verify the binding against the live run
 * ```
 *
 * **Fail loud on a non-stable snapshot.** A packet's `source_snapshot_sha256`
 * claims "these are the records this context was chosen from". If the store moved
 * mid-collection the claim is already false, and if a source was unreadable it
 * was never true. Selecting from such a collection would put a Worker's whole
 * context budget behind a provenance value that identifies no moment, so
 * delivery refuses instead of building a packet that looks reproducible.
 *
 * **The binding is checked, not merely written.** `recordCollaborationRunContext
 * Binding()` and `assertCollaborationDispatchBinding()` both run the same pure
 * check from `run-binding.ts`, against the live delegation records rather than
 * against the values the caller passed in. Recording proves the goal reaching the
 * envelope is the goal that was composed; the fence proves it again at dispatch,
 * when the run is about to actually happen and any of it may have moved.
 *
 * **No second destination resolver.** C4's `authorizeCollaborationDestination()`
 * binds an actor to a public or candidate shard, because those records have an
 * author whose visibility must be constrained. A context packet and a run
 * binding have no author: the Host builds both from records that are already
 * committed, exactly as `promoteCollaborationCandidate()` derives its target
 * without taking a destination. Giving them a destination value would create a
 * second thing a caller could aim somewhere else, so they are written to their
 * own Host-owned shards directly.
 *
 * **The Delegation protocol is untouched.** Nothing here writes an envelope, an
 * intent, an admission or an observation, and no delegation record grows a field.
 * `intent.context_packet_sha256` is read with the meaning C0's D2 froze — the
 * ExecutionPacket digest — and is cross-checked against the envelope rather than
 * reinterpreted.

 *   fence checks.
 *
 * `delegation_only` therefore means "no binding and no marker", which is exactly
 * a run this row makes no claim about. Everything else must produce a binding
 * that reproduces the goal being dispatched.

 * carrying a partial or malformed block is a collaboration dispatch whose binding
