/**
 * The append-only `HandoffAdoptionReceiptV1` store.
 *
 * Sprint row C3. Adoption is non-exclusive, and this store is where that has to
 * survive contact with concurrency: two distinct adopters of one handoff derive
 * two distinct identities and both writes succeed, while one adopter repeating
 * the same triple converges on the receipt it already wrote. There is no
 * first-adopter-wins branch anywhere below, because there is no such rule.
 *
 * Zero delivery-plane write (D1). Adopting knowledge opens no Task, Lease,
 * Publication or Acceptance store for writing and changes no ownership: the
 * adopter becomes a writer only through the existing release / takeover /
 * acquire lifecycle, exactly as before adopting.
