/**
 * Succession — the join between what one run knows and who is allowed to act on
 * it.
 *
 * Sprint row C5, and the frozen three-way sentence stated as code:
 *
 * > `WorkStateHandoff` passes knowledge, `TaskFreezeReceiptV1` passes exact
 * > state, and the existing Lease lifecycle passes the right to execute.
 *
 * Nothing here is a fourth mechanism. There is no successor election, no
 * successor field on any record, no new protocol, no new store and no second
 * write destination: the entire row is a cross-check between two record families
 * that already exist, plus a refusal in front of the delivery plane.
 *
 * **The gap this closes.** `HandoffExecutionContextV1.bound_task` names a Claim
 * and a freeze receipt by digest, and C3 validated its *shape* — six well-formed
 * references, present together or not at all. Shape is not truth. A caller could
 * state any syntactically valid `claim_id`, `lease_generation` and
 * `task_freeze_receipt_sha256`, and the record would validate, persist and read
 * back clean while naming a receipt that does not exist or describes different
 * bytes. The successor would then reconstruct a state nobody ever froze, which is
 * strictly worse than having no handoff: it looks like evidence.
 *
 * C3 could not have closed it. The check needs a delivery-plane reader, and
 * importing the freeze store into the schema layer would invert the direction D1
 * froze. C5 is the first row holding both sides, so the cross-check lives here,
 * in `effects`, beside the other cross-plane adapter (`admission-bridge.ts`).
 *
 * **Derive on write, prove on read.** `publishBoundTaskSuccessionHandoff()`
 * derives the execution context *from* the persisted receipt rather than
 * accepting one and validating it, so on that path the mismatched record cannot
 * be expressed at all. `resolveBoundTaskSuccession()` still performs the
 * comparison, because a handoff persisted by any other route — a later row, a
 * hand-written record, a restored backup — has to be provable at read time. One
 * derivation, one comparison, used from both sides.
 *
 * Zero delivery-plane write (D1). Every delivery-plane touch below is a read or
 * a refusal. The only write this module can cause is one `WorkStateHandoffV1`
 * through the existing C3 store, at the existing destination authorizer.
