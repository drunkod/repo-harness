/**
 * The Host contribution collector — one delegated run's output becoming visible
 * collaboration state, exactly once.
 *
 * Sprint row C4. The transaction, in the order the PRD freezes it:
 *
 * ```text
 * read the draft from the exact persisted stdout (versioned adapter)
 * -> validate the whole draft
 * -> derive every id from WorkerRunRef + entry index
 * -> build every candidate in full, before any write
 * -> publish candidates immutably
 * -> publish one CollaborationContributionCommitV1 (the visibility boundary)
 * -> construct the single WorkerResultV1, referencing that commit
 * ```
 *
 * **Why it converges.** Every write in that list is content-addressed under an
 * identity derived from the run, not from the moment of writing: the signal ids
 * come from `<run_ref>#<index>`, the handoff id from `<run_ref>#handoff`, the
 * commit id from the run reference alone, and the recorded time from the process
 * receipt's own `observed_at` rather than from a clock. A retry after a crash at
 * *any* boundary therefore recomputes byte-identical records, and each store's
 * create-once branch reconciles them instead of appending. There is no
 * "resume from step N" state anywhere below, because there is nothing to resume:
 * re-running the whole transaction is the recovery path.
 *
 * **Why the commit is last.** Candidates are ordinary signals and handoffs. What
 * makes them a contribution is being named by a commit, and a projection reads
 * only committed contributions. So a crash before the commit leaves records that
 * no reader can see, and the retry publishes the same records and then the
 * commit; a crash after the commit leaves a complete contribution, and the retry
 * reconciles every write to what is already there.
 *
 * **Why a parse failure still persists a WorkerResult.** An unusable output is a
 * real run outcome, and the run's evidence has to survive it. What must not
 * survive is any appearance of contribution: no candidate is written, no commit
 * exists, and the result carries no commit reference. The collector never
 * synthesises an empty draft to keep the flow going.
 *
 * Zero delivery-plane write (D1): the signal, handoff and commit stores are
 * collaboration-plane, and the `WorkerResultV1` is written through the existing
 * `collectDelegatedRunResult()`, which is the delegation plane writing its own
 * evidence exactly as it did before this row.

/**
 * The whole write side of the transaction, in one named top-level function.
 *
 * ## Ordering: stage invisibly, commit, then promote
 *
 * ```text
 * 1. stage every candidate under contribution-candidates/<run>/{signals,handoffs}/
 * 2. publish the CollaborationContributionCommitV1
 * 3. promote each candidate into signals/ and handoffs/ by link
 * 4. construct the single WorkerResultV1
 * ```
 *
 * The commit is written *before* promotion, and that ordering is the whole
 * point. It makes one invariant hold at every instant, including inside every
 * crash window:
 *
 * > **Every publicly readable Worker record is already committed.**
 *
 * The earlier shape published candidates straight into the public shards and
 * relied on readers filtering by commit. That is a reader-side obligation, and a
 * crash during staging left Worker records permanently readable by
 * `listCoordinationSignals()` with no commit referencing them and no recall path
 * in an append-only store. Here invisibility is a property of *where* a candidate
 * lives, so a reader that forgets a filter cannot leak an uncommitted record.
 *
 * ## Crash windows
 *
 * | Window | Public state | Residue | Resolution |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | during staging (1) | nothing | candidates only, which no public reader opens | retry re-stages to identical bytes at identical names; reconciles |
 * | after staging, before the commit lands (2) | nothing | candidates only | retry publishes the commit and promotes |
 * | after the commit, mid-promotion (3) | the records promoted so far, all of them committed | none that is both public and uncommitted | retry promotes the rest; `EEXIST` on the ones already promoted |
 * | after promotion, before the WorkerResult (4) | complete and committed | none | retry reconciles every write and constructs the result |
 * | after the WorkerResult (5) | complete and committed | none | retry is fully idempotent |
 *
 * Every window self-heals on retry, and no window is publicly readable without
 * its commit. The window this ordering accepts is the mirror image: in (3) a
 * commit can name a record that is not public yet, so a reader following
 * `commit.signal_refs` may find one missing. That is transient, it closes on the
 * next collection of the same run, and it is the honest trade — the alternative
 * ordering makes uncommitted records publicly visible instead, which is the
 * failure this row exists to remove.
 *
 * Convergence is structural rather than procedural. There is no resume marker
 * anywhere below, because every identity is derived from the run: signal ids from
 * `<run_ref>#<index>`, the handoff from `<run_ref>#handoff`, the commit from the
 * run reference alone, and the recorded time from the process receipt's own
 * `observed_at`. Re-running the whole transaction *is* the recovery path.
 *
 * It is a named top-level function rather than an inline lock callback so the
 * edges out of it — the two stores, the commit publish, the promotions and the
 * single `WorkerResultV1` — are direct calls a reader, and the architecture flow
 * proof, can follow.
