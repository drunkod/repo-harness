# PRD: Writable Worker Grant (ME-2B)

> **Status**: Draft
> **Slug**: `writable-worker-grant`
> **Created**: 2026-08-24T16:53:00+0800
> **Updated**: 2026-08-26T17:32:00+0800
> **Source Spec**: `docs/spec.md`
> **Parent PRD**: `plans/prds/20260824-1653-persistent-module-engineer-organization.prd.md`
> **Depends On**: ME-0B, ME-2A, an Approved ME-3B Delegated Run Adapter, and a separate managed-Parent/sandbox canary; current Contract/Lease/WorkEnvelope
> **Tier**: compact
> **Runtime Admission Decision**: Not admitted on Codex Host/CLI 0.149.0; writable delegation remains disabled and no grant surface is implemented

## AI Quick-Read Card

- **Problem**: a writable Worker needs mutation-time authority while Parent Engineer and every other child are provably unable to write the same worktree.
- **Users**: managed Module Engineer, writable Worker, runtime operator and Acceptance Plane.
- **Platform**: runtime-controlled Parent/child processes, exclusive writer actor, OS sandbox and runtime-observed Git state；no generic Agent loop。
- **P0 surface**: `WriterActorCurrentV1`, `DelegatedMutationGrantV1`, host-enforced Parent freeze, writer actor CAS, mutation guard, settlement and crash recovery.
- **Core metric**: writer overlap 0; path/policy escape 0; publication before settlement 0.
- **Hard constraint**: unmanaged Provider Sessions remain read-only; prompt text or a store flag cannot freeze their filesystem permissions.
- **Key risk**: Parent retains shell/edit authority after the store says Worker owns the slot.
- **Closed runtime result**: the dedicated model-free canary proved only launch-scoped sandboxing. The version-pinned Codex CLI 0.149.0 adapter has no dynamic revocation or effect-principal probe, so it cannot produce the positive evidence required for writable admission.
- **Acceptance scenarios**: Parent-to-Worker handoff, second writer refusal, mutation-time revalidation, crash recovery and observed diff.
- **Suggested next step**: keep disabled/read-only. Reopen only when the Provider/Host exposes dynamic live-Session permission replacement plus an effect-time runtime principal/epoch receipt; do not build a repo-harness Agent runtime to compensate.

## Problem

`max_parallel_writers: 1` is meaningless if it counts only Workers. The exclusive writer domain includes the Parent Engineer. Every mutation path, including shell children and formatters, must be constrained by the Host and sandbox.

### Product Direction

Writable delegation is enabled only for an Engineer Session whose execution boundary is managed by an Approved ME-3B adapter plus a proven OS/process sandbox. The runtime boundary freezes Parent write capability before activating the Worker grant, revalidates grant epoch and parent Lease at mutation boundaries, observes actual Git state, and blocks publication/new writers until settlement.

### Feasibility Boundary

- **Confirmed**: store CAS and Git diff observation are available locally.
- **Not available through the examined adapter**: Codex CLI 0.149.0 applies `:read-only` or `:workspace` when a process starts. The exact version-pinned public CLI adapter has no supported action for replacing the sandbox of an already-running Parent or authenticating principal/epoch at each effect.
- **Fail closed**: unmanaged/manual Session, unverifiable runtime principal or missing sandbox means read-only only.

### Runtime Admission Decision (2026-08-26)

The dedicated canary is complete and returns `runtime_not_admitted`.

- Runtime: `/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/codex/0.149.0/bin/codex`, executable `sha256:f4a74117b8142cda581c95ff753abf4508b5636d89682c1ed77e4a9249af8963`, version `codex-cli 0.149.0`.
- Control A: built-in `:read-only` denied the disposable worktree sentinel with exit `1` / `Operation not permitted`.
- Control B: built-in `:workspace` admitted the same worktree class with exit `0`.
- Static control only: one already-running `:workspace` Parent wrote on both sides of a neutral checkpoint and exited `0`. This demonstrates persistence of a launch-scoped profile; the checkpoint is explicitly not represented as a revocation attempt.
- Missing authority: the `codex-cli-0.149.0-launch-only/v1` adapter has neither a dynamic Parent-revocation probe nor an authenticated `worker_run_id`/grant-epoch probe at the filesystem effect boundary.
- Decision reasons: `dynamic_parent_revocation_probe_unavailable`, `child_principal_at_effect_probe_unavailable`.

Therefore this PRD remains Draft by design. `WriterActorCurrentV1` and `DelegatedMutationGrantV1` are specification-only; no product code, MCP/CLI mutation, architecture node or fallback writer path is authorized. ME-2B is complete as a negative feasibility decision and does not block the read-only ME-2A/ME-3B path or ME-4C Acceptance.

## Users

### Primary Users

- Managed Module Engineer delegating one bounded mutation unit.
- Managed runtime/security boundary enforcing the writer domain.

### Secondary Users

- Gatekeeper reading settled evidence; it never inherits the grant.

## Success Criteria

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Degradation Threshold |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| Concurrent writer actors | ≤1 | race/fault fixtures | >1 |
| Mutation outside grant | 0 | sandbox matrix | any |
| Parent writes while Worker active | 0 | process/filesystem fixture | any |
| Publication before settlement | 0 | transition fixture | any |

## Acceptance Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Parent freeze precedes grant

Parent begins as writer. Host revokes Parent mutation capability, records the freeze receipt, then CAS-activates Worker actor. Reversed or partial order fails closed.

### Scenario 2: Worker crash

After observed mutation, runtime disappears. Grant enters `recovery_required`; Parent remains read-only and publication/new writer admission is blocked until Human-directed settlement.

### Scenario 3: Mutation-time stale grant

Grant is revoked between command admission and effect. The effect boundary revalidates epoch/state and denies mutation.

## Non-goals

- Manual Provider Session write delegation.
- Second Lease, automatic merge, publication or Acceptance.
- Prompt-only allowed paths or hook-only filesystem security.

## Module Behaviors (P0)

### Module 1: Writer Election

Under one lock, validate Parent Claim/Host principal, publish `freezing_parent`, drain/revoke Parent mutation, publish `worker_pending`, activate/observe the child sandbox, then publish `worker_active` and the immutable grant.

### Module 2: Mutation and Settlement

Every effect revalidates Lease, grant epoch/state, runtime principal, actor and sandbox policy. Host captures before/after Git state and settles or enters recovery.

## Data Model

```yaml
WriterActorCurrentV1:
  protocol: 1
  kind: repo-harness-writer-actor-current
  writer_epoch: integer
  worktree_path: string
  branch: string
  unit_ref: string
  parent: {engineer_id: string, binding_id: uuid, binding_generation: integer, claim_id: uuid, lease_generation: integer}
  state: engineer_active|freezing_parent|worker_pending|worker_active|settling|engineer_restoring|recovery_required
  writer_actor: engineer:<binding-id>|worker:<worker-run-id>|none
  worker_run_id: uuid|null
  grant_id: uuid|null
  parent_freeze_receipt_sha256: sha256|null
  worker_runtime_observation_sha256: sha256|null
  previous_current_digest: sha256|null
  current_digest: sha256

DelegatedMutationGrantV1:
  protocol: 1
  grant_id: uuid
  grant_epoch: integer
  parent: {task_id: sha256, task_revision: sha256, claim_id: uuid, lease_generation: integer}
  delegation_id: uuid
  worker_run_id: uuid
  runtime_principal_id: opaque
  worktree: string
  branch: string
  unit_ref: string
  allowed_paths_digest: sha256
  sandbox_policy_digest: sha256
  network_policy_digest: sha256
  command_policy_digest: sha256
  parent_freeze_receipt_sha256: sha256
  writer_actor: worker:<worker-run-id>
  state: active|revoking|revoked|settled|expired|recovery_required
  issued_at: datetime
  expires_at: datetime
  settled_at: datetime|null
  grant_sha256: sha256
```

The current writer-slot protocol is ordered and fail closed:

```text
engineer_active
→ freezing_parent
→ worker_pending
→ worker_active
→ settling
→ engineer_restoring
→ engineer_active
```

Every mutation broker revalidates `WriterActorCurrentV1` immediately before effect. `freezing_parent`, `worker_pending`, `settling`, `engineer_restoring` and `recovery_required` admit no mutation or publication. Crash before Parent freeze is proven returns `freezing_parent`; Host restart must stop/drain Parent and either continue or enter recovery. A child activated before `worker_active` is denied by the broker. Crash after `worker_active` preserves only the exact Worker grant. Settlement first revokes/drains Worker, publishes `settling`, observes Git state, publishes `engineer_restoring`, restores/observes Parent, then CAS-publishes `engineer_active`. Any unverifiable external effect enters `recovery_required` and requires Human-directed reconciliation.

## Known Unknowns

| Item | Impact | Resolution Path | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Managed Parent permission revocation | Canary returned no-go; blocks activation | Reopen only for a Host API that changes a live Parent sandbox without terminating its control role | Runtime owner |
| Child principal at every effect | Canary returned no-go; blocks activation | Reopen only for an authenticated runtime principal plus grant epoch enforced at the filesystem/effect broker | Security owner |

## Developer Handoff

The dedicated security canary has returned no-go. Do not implement the grant records or any writable adapter on the current runtime. No unmanaged Session compatibility mode is allowed；absence of enforcement means read-only, not a fallback writer path. The exact revisit trigger is recorded in `tasks/todos.md` and `docs/researches/20260826-me2b-managed-parent-sandbox-canary.md`.

### Acceptance Scripts

1. Race Parent and two Workers; assert one active writer actor.
2. Attempt Parent shell/edit while Worker is active; assert OS/effect denial.
3. Revoke between admission/effect and assert no mutation.
4. Crash after dirtying files; assert recovery lock and host-observed diff.
5. Attempt publication before settlement; assert typed refusal.
6. Inject a crash at every boundary between current CAS, Parent revoke, child activation, Worker revoke and Parent restore; assert no overlap and the unique recovery state above.
