## Agentic Routing
- Selected route: planning
- Routing reason: Captured from codex-plan-or-waza-think planning output.
- Source ref: (none)
- Due diligence:
  - P1 map: See captured planning output below.
  - P2 trace: See captured planning output below.
  - P3 decision rationale: See captured planning output below.

## Workflow Inventory
Complete this inventory before implementation. If any line is unknown, keep the plan in Draft and fill it before projection.

- Active plan: `plans/archive/plan-20260922-1417-akn03b-windows-fixture.md`
- Sprint contract: `tasks/archive/contract-20260922-1532-akn03b-windows-fixture.md`
- Sprint review: `tasks/archive/review-20260922-1532-akn03b-windows-fixture.md`
- Implementation notes: `tasks/archive/notes-20260922-1532-akn03b-windows-fixture.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Current checks: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope authority: `tasks/archive/contract-20260922-1532-akn03b-windows-fixture.md` `allowed_paths`
- Concurrency rule: `.ai/harness/active-plan` selects the active plan for this worktree when present; `.ai/harness/active-worktree` records the owning worktree. If another worktree already owns active work, open or switch to the matching worktree instead of serializing unrelated plans.
- Execution isolation: approved contract-level work projects through `repo-harness run plan-to-todo --plan plans/archive/plan-20260922-1417-akn03b-windows-fixture.md` and may start `repo-harness run contract-worktree start --plan plans/archive/plan-20260922-1417-akn03b-windows-fixture.md`.

## Approach
### Strategy
Use the captured planning output below as the execution source of truth.

### Trade-offs
| Option | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| Captured plan | Preserves the approved Codex Plan or Waza think decision | Requires the captured text to be concrete enough to execute | Use |

## Detailed Design
### File Changes
| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| See captured planning output | Follow | Implement only the approved scope named below |

### Code Snippets
See captured planning output.

### Data Flow
See captured planning output.

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Captured plan lacks enough detail | Medium | Execution may need clarification | Stop before implementation if the captured output contradicts repo rules or lacks concrete file targets |

## Task Contracts
- Contract file: `tasks/archive/contract-20260922-1532-akn03b-windows-fixture.md`
- Review file: `tasks/archive/review-20260922-1532-akn03b-windows-fixture.md`
- Implementation notes file: `tasks/archive/notes-20260922-1532-akn03b-windows-fixture.md`
- Template: `.claude/templates/contract.template.md`
- Verification command: `repo-harness run verify-contract --contract tasks/archive/contract-20260922-1532-akn03b-windows-fixture.md --strict`
- Active plan rule: this captured plan is written to `.ai/harness/active-plan` and the owning worktree is written to `.ai/harness/active-worktree` unless --no-active is used. Do not infer active execution from the latest non-archived plan.

## Handoff

- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Session handoff: `.ai/harness/handoff/current.md`

## Promotion Gate

- **Merge/PR unit**: Captured plan `plans/archive/plan-20260922-1417-akn03b-windows-fixture.md` is the proposed mergeable execution unit; revise before execute if this is only a checklist step.
- **Rollback surface**: One fixture-only correction to PR 437
- **Verification boundary**: Windows MCP HTTP fixture and unchanged authenticated transport assertions
- **Review/acceptance boundary**: `tasks/archive/review-20260922-1532-akn03b-windows-fixture.md` must record pass against the captured acceptance criteria.
- **High-risk surface**: Risks named in captured planning output; keep the plan Draft if risk ownership is not concrete.
- **Why not checklist row**: verification_boundary

## Evidence Contract

- **State/progress path**: `plans/archive/plan-20260922-1417-akn03b-windows-fixture.md` task breakdown, `tasks/todos.md` deferred-goal ledger, `tasks/archive/contract-20260922-1532-akn03b-windows-fixture.md`, `tasks/archive/review-20260922-1532-akn03b-windows-fixture.md`, and `tasks/archive/notes-20260922-1532-akn03b-windows-fixture.md`
- **Verification evidence**: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`, `.ai/harness/runs/`, and the commands named in the captured planning output
- **Evaluator rubric**: `tasks/archive/review-20260922-1532-akn03b-windows-fixture.md` must record a passing Waza /check style recommendation
- **Stop condition**: all task breakdown items are complete, sprint verification passes, and the review recommends pass
- **Rollback surface**: One fixture-only correction to PR 437

## Captured Planning Output

## Goal

Repair the AKN-03b Windows MCP HTTP fixture failure on PR #437 without weakening production Binding or principal-store durability. Update that PR after current verification and one semantic acceptance.

## Scope

Only tests/cli/mcp-http.test.ts, the existing Task reply research document, generated architecture manifest and this package workflow artifacts. Reuse the current isolated codex/akn03-protected-replies worktree. No production behavior changes, merge, runtime installation or new indexing scope.

## P1 / P2 / P3

The real Windows job 106634890098 in run 35693364932 fails at tests/cli/mcp-http.test.ts:1107 -> bindEngineer -> withEngineerLock -> ensureSafeDirectory -> fsyncDirectory with EPERM. The HTTP test verifies OAuth request identity and closed tools, not writer durability. Seed canonical Binding event/current and principal mapping bytes with their existing validated core constructors, then exercise the unchanged production HTTP/reader path. Keep the fsync writers unchanged. At scale fixture setup cost is bounded; no production performance change is claimed.

## Task Breakdown

- [ ] Replace only the HTTP fixture writer setup and retain all existing authenticated HTTP assertions.
- [ ] Run focused HTTP/type and required integrity checks, obtain one semantic acceptance, update PR #437 and inspect Windows CI.

## Verification

Existing tests/cli/mcp-http.test.ts is the regression guard; hosted Windows failure is the pre-fix evidence. Run it locally and require the actual Windows job to pass before calling Windows acceptance complete. No full suite and no platform skip.

## Rollback

Revert this fixture-only correction as one commit; prior source semantics and durable records remain untouched.

## Task Breakdown
- [ ] Replace only the HTTP fixture writer setup and retain all existing authenticated HTTP assertions.
- [ ] Run focused HTTP/type and required integrity checks, obtain one semantic acceptance, update PR #437 and inspect Windows CI.

## Scope revision: publication-time expiry

The one semantic review found an unmet original AKN-03 publication-time authorization requirement. Expand this same package before source edits; preserve the rejection and do not request another review of the same boundary.

P1: Engineer composition owns request-token validation and mapping/Binding/Claim checks under existing locks. Fleet inbox owns durable record staging and link/rename publication.
P2: token check -> synchronous mapping/registry/Claim/Git validation -> writer staging/fsync -> public record. Expiry can occur in either intervening interval; no lock freezes time.
P3: retain the early check for fast rejection and recheck after canonical validation; pass final authority callbacks to restricted delivery/ACK and event writers after staging and before rename/link. Intent/commit already expose this boundary and gain the final token check through composition. Keep general local-operator writers unchanged. No serialized format or permission authority changes; at 10x concurrency existing per-Task locks still bound throughput, and the extra verification cost is limited to authenticated publication.

- [ ] Capture pre-fix failure using real staging fsync and controlled expiry during canonical validation.
- [ ] Fix the existing writer callbacks and final token validation, rerun focused coverage and canonical checks once source is frozen.
- [ ] Preserve semantic rejection until corrected subject obtains valid acceptance; no main merge or runtime installation.

## Owner review revision: encoded reply record boundary

P1: core message validation owns 8 KiB raw UTF-8 body limits, core reply validation composes parent/ACK/mapping/actor/reply, and Fleet persistence currently alone owns a 64 KiB encoded record bound. Some metadata strings are unbounded by their source schema.
P2: individually valid 8192-byte control-character parent and reply expand beyond 98 KiB when encoded, then fail only at persistence.
P3: retain the existing storage ceiling as an explicit 64 KiB total canonical UTF-8 record limit including the trailing LF. Export it from the reply contract, apply it in intent/commit construction and validation, and use it for disk read/write bounds. This avoids inventing a larger constant or changing identity schemas. A legal message body alone does not guarantee the full reply envelope fits. Reject before intent persistence so the same ID can be retried with a smaller body; retain raw-body limits and exact bytes. At 10x size, fail before writes instead of consuming disk or replacing identity.

- [ ] Capture pre-fix core and effects failures for JSON expansion and early rejection.
- [ ] Implement the common encoded limit; verify escaping, UTF-8, exact limit, one byte above, reader/writer agreement and same-ID retry.
- [ ] Attribute CI failures to exact jobs and source; run the installed-package path selected from that evidence.
- [ ] Reaccept the corrected frozen subject under the owner's latest explicit review request; preserve prior rejection history.
